Raman mode intensity from substrates has been used to\nidentify N of intrinsic and defective multilayer graphenes up to N=100.\nHowever, such analysis is not applicable for ultrathin TMD flakes due to the\nlack of a unified complex refractive index ($\\tilde{n}$) from monolayer to bulk\nTMDs. Here, we discuss the N identification of TMD flakes on the SiO$_2$/Si\nsubstrate by the intensity ratio between the Si peak from 100-nm (or 89-nm)\nSiO$_2$/Si substrates underneath TMD flakes and that from bare SiO$_2$/Si\nsubstrates. We assume the real part of $\\tilde{n}$ of TMD flakes as that of\nmonolayer TMD and treat the imaginary part of $\\tilde{n}$ as a fitting\nparameter to fit the experimental intensity ratio.

Such a transformation yields a new decomposition for the inverse\nof a Toeplitz matrix and enables the representation of the Gaussian likelihood\nwithin the frequency domain. We show that the difference between the Gaussian\nand Whittle likelihood is due to the omission of the best linear predictions\noutside the domain of observation in the periodogram associated with the\nWhittle likelihood. Based on this result, we obtain an approximation for the\ndifference between the Gaussian and Whittle likelihoods in terms of the best\nfitting, finite order autoregressive parameters. These approximations are used\nto define two new frequency domain quasi-likelihoods criteria. We show that\nthese new criteria can yield a better approximation of the spectral divergence\ncriterion, as compared to both the Gaussian and Whittle likelihoods. In\nsimulations, we show that the proposed estimators have satisfactory finite\nsample properties."}, "authors": [{"name": "Suhasini Subba Rao"}, {"name": "Junho Yang"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Junho Yang"}, "author": "Junho Yang", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06966v3", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06966v3", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "math.ST", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "math.ST", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "stat.TH", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07402v4", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07402v4", "updated": "2021-11-08T14:36:24Z", "updated_parsed": [2021, 11, 8, 14, 36, 24, 0, 312, 0], "published": "2021-05-16T10:37:36Z", "published_parsed": [2021, 5, 16, 10, 37, 36, 6, 136, 0], "title": "Is the aspect ratio of cells important in deep learning?

Comparing wind turbine data\npresents new problems, namely the need to identify the regions of difference in\nthe input space and to quantify the extent of difference that is statistically\nsignificant. Our proposed method, referred to as funGP, estimates the\nunderlying functions for different data samples using Gaussian process models.\nWe build a confidence band using the probability law of the estimated function\ndifferences under the null hypothesis. Then, the confidence band is used for\nthe hypothesis test as well as for identifying the regions of difference. This\nidentification of difference regions is a distinct feature, as existing methods\ntend to conduct an overall hypothesis test stating whether two functions are\ndifferent. Understanding the difference regions can lead to further practical\ninsights and help devise better control and maintenance strategies for wind\nturbines.

We mainly focus on asymptotic properties of\nthe sequence $f_r^v(k,n),$ the number of $n$-array $k$-ary words that contain a\ngiven pattern $v$ exactly $r$ times. In addition, we study the asymptotic\nbehavior of the random variable $X_n,$ the number of pattern occurrences in a\nrandom $n$-array word. The two topics are closely related through the identity\n$P(X_n=r) = $ $\\frac{1}{k^n}f_r^v(k,n).$ In particular, we show that for any\n$r\\geq 0,$ the Stanley-Wilf sequence $\\bigl(f_r^v(k,n)\\bigr)^{1/n}$ converges\nto a limit independent of $r,$ and determine the value of the limit. We then\nobtain several limit theorems for the distribution of $X_n,$ including a CLT,\nlarge deviation estimates, and the exact growth rate of the entropy of $X_n.$\nFurthermore, we introduce a concept of weak avoidance and link it to a certain\nfamily of non-product measures on words that penalize pattern occurrences but\ndo not forbid them entirely.

We use the hierarchical solution\ndistributions in a variational Bayesian approximation to perform uncertainty\nquantification in the inverse problem.

There are many ways to look at this newer\napproach and one such is to realize that the order of the fractional derivative\nis related to the time scales of the underlying diffusion process. This raises\nthe question of what order ? of derivative should be taken and if a single\nvalue actually suffices. This has led to models that combine a finite number of\nthese derivatives each with a different fractional exponent \\alpha_k and\ndifferent weighting value c_k to better model a greater possible range of time\nscales. Ultimately, one wants to look at a situation that combines derivatives\nin a continuous way { the so-called distributional model with parameter\n\\mu(\\alpha). However all of this begs the question of how one determines this\n\"order\" of differentiation.

Some works have considered generalizing this setting with\nthe use of a nonlinear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal trajectories\nbut the proposed estimation procedures based on likelihood approximations have\nbeen shown De la Cruz et al. (2011) to exhibit some computational efficiency\nproblems. In this article we propose an MCMC-based estimation procedure in the\njoint model with a nonlinear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal data and\na generalized linear model for the primary response. Moreover, we consider that\nthe errors in the longitudinal model may be correlated. We apply our method to\nthe analysis of hormone levels measured at the early stages of pregnancy that\ncan be used to predict normal versus abnormal pregnancy outcomes. We also\nconduct a simulation study to asses the importance of modelling correlated\nerrors and quantify the consequences of model misspecification."}, "authors": [{"name": "Rolando De la Cruz"}, {"name": "Cristian Meza"}, {"name": "Ana Arribas-Gil"}, {"name": "Raymond J.

This paper introduces finite-horizon dynamic\nprogramming for MOCU-based sequential experimental design and compares it to\nthe greedy approach, which selects one experiment at a time without\nconsideration of the full horizon of experiments. A salient aspect of the paper\nis that it demonstrates the advantage of MOCU-based design over the widely used\nentropy-based design for both greedy and dynamic-programming strategies and\ninvestigates the effect of model conditions on the comparative performances."}, "authors": [{"name": "Mahdi Imani"}, {"name": "Roozbeh Dehghannasiri"}, {"name": "Ulisses M.

In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks.

However, finding the optimum\nstopping rule in this case requires numerical computations that {\\em\nquadratically} scales with the number of parameters to be estimated. For the\ndecentralized setup with stringent energy constraints, under an alternative\nproblem formulation that is conditional on the observed regressors, we first\nderive a simple optimum scheme whose computational complexity is {\\em constant}\nwith respect to the number of parameters. Then, following this simple optimum\nscheme we propose a decentralized sequential estimator whose computational\ncomplexity and energy consumption scales {\\em linearly} with the number of\nparameters. Specifically, in the proposed decentralized scheme a\nclose-to-optimum average stopping time performance is achieved by infrequently\ntransmitting a single pulse with very short duration."}, "authors": [{"name": "Yasin Yilmaz"}, {"name": "George V.

Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk\nassessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data\nscience, and computer science to identify domain-specific CRIs and their union\nin systemic risk indicators."}, "authors": [{"name": "Judy P.
