The field defined in both frames of\nsuch \"flat\" biframe spacetime can be quantized and plays the role as the\ngravity field which couples with all the fields to connect the gravity effect\nwith the standard model.

If $f\\in\nPW_{\\beta B_2}$, then $f=\\lim_{\\lambda\\to 0^+} I_\\lambda(f)$ in $L_2(\\R^d)$ and\nuniformly on $\\R^d$. If $\\delta=1$, then one may take $\\beta$ to be 1 as well,\nand this reduces to a known theorem in the univariate case. However, if\n$d\\ge2$, it is not known whether $L_2(B_2)$ admits a Riesz-basis sequence. On\nthe other hand, in the case when $\\delta<1$, there do exist bodies $Z$\nsatisfying the hypotheses of the theorem (in any space dimension)."}, "authors": [{"name": "A. Bailey"}, {"name": "Th.

In conjunction with earlier established connections between\nthe Busemann-Petty problem, intersection bodies, and positive definite\ndistributions, our formula shows that the answer to the problem depends on the\nbehavior of the (n-2)-nd derivative of the parallel section functions.

This is then used in the inverse problem\nof recovering the distributional coefficient \\mu(\\alpha) from a time trace of\nthe solution and a uniqueness result is proven."}, "authors": [{"name": "William Rundell"}, {"name": "Zhidong Zhang"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Zhidong Zhang"}, "author": "Zhidong Zhang", "arxiv_doi": "10.1088/1361-6420/aa573e", "links": [{"title": "doi", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6420/aa573e", "rel": "related", "type": "text/html"}, {"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02840v2", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02840v2", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_comment": "24 pages", "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "math.AP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "math.AP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "35R30, 26A33, 60C22, 34A08", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00845v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00845v1", "updated": "2015-07-03T08:22:44Z", "updated_parsed": [2015, 7, 3, 8, 22, 44, 4, 184, 0], "published": "2015-07-03T08:22:44Z", "published_parsed": [2015, 7, 3, 8, 22, 44, 4, 184, 0], "title": "Strong maximum principle for fractional diffusion equations and an\n  application to an inverse source problem", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Strong maximum principle for fractional diffusion equations and an\n  application to an inverse source problem"}, "summary": "The strong maximum principle is a remarkable characterization of parabolic\nequations, which is expected to be partly inherited by fractional diffusion\nequations.

Our proposed method consists of identifying\nmulti-continua parameters via local basis functions and constructing non-local\n(in the oversampled region) transfer and effective properties. To achieve this,\nwe significantly modify our recent work proposed within Generalized Multiscale\nFinite Element Method (GMsFEM) in [10] and derive appropriate local problems in\noversampled regions once we identify important modes representing each\ncontinua. We use piecewise constant functions in each fracture network and in\nthe matrix to write an upscaled equation. Thus, the resulting upscaled equation\nis of minimal size and the unknowns are average pressures in the fractures and\nthe matrix. We note that the use of non-local upscaled model for porous media\nflows is not new, e.g., in [14], the authors derive non-local approach. Our\nmain contribution is identifying appropriate local problems together with local\nspectral modes to represent each continua.

Thus,\nmultilevel methods are desirable for problems with complex heterogeneities and\nhigh contrast. In this paper, we propose a novel three-level upscaling method\nfor flow problems in fractured porous media. Our method starts with a fine grid\ndiscretization for the system involving fractured porous media. In the next\nstep, based on the fine grid model, we construct a nonlocal multi-continua\nupscaling (NLMC) method using an intermediate grid. The system resulting from\nNLMC gives solutions that have physical meaning.

In particular, we show that the online procedure has a rapid\nconvergence with a rate related to the number of offline basis functions, and\none can obtain fast convergence by a sufficient number of offline basis\nfunctions, which are computed in the offline stage. To illustrate the\nperformance of our method, we present numerical results with both small and\nlarge perforations. We see that only a few (1 or 2) online iterations can\nsignificantly improve the offline solution."}, "authors": [{"name": "Eric T.

In particular, we emphasize the role of the vector-valued corrector\nfield, which expresses microscopic modes of surface waves on the 2D material.\nWe demonstrate how our homogenization procedure may set the foundation for\ncomputational investigations of: effective optical responses of reasonably\ngeneral geometries, and complicated design problems in the plasmonics of 2D\nmaterials."}, "authors": [{"name": "Matthias Maier"}, {"name": "Marios Mattheakis"}, {"name": "Efthimios Kaxiras"}, {"name": "Mitchell Luskin"}, {"name": "Dionisios Margetis"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Dionisios Margetis"}, "author": "Dionisios Margetis", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08276v2", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08276v2", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "math.NA", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "math.NA", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "cond-mat.mes-hall", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "35B27, 35Q60, 74Q10", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02784v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02784v1", "updated": "2017-01-10T21:05:57Z", "updated_parsed": [2017, 1, 10, 21, 5, 57, 1, 10, 0], "published": "2017-01-10T21:05:57Z", "published_parsed": [2017, 1, 10, 21, 5, 57, 1, 10, 0], "title": "On the Wiener-Hopf method for surface plasmons: Diffraction from\n  semi-infinite metamaterial sheet", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "On the Wiener-Hopf method for surface plasmons: Diffraction from\n  semi-infinite metamaterial sheet"}, "summary": "By formally invoking the Wiener-Hopf method, we explicitly solve a\none-dimensional, singular integral equation for the excitation of a slowly\ndecaying electromagnetic wave, called surface plasmon-polariton (SPP), of small\nwavelength on a semi-infinite, flat conducting sheet irradiated by a plane wave\nin two spatial dimensions.

Avellaneda and F. H. Lin and\nadvanced further by J. Moser and M. Struwe. It pertains periodic elliptic\noperators of divergent type, where, surprisingly, exact dimensions can be\ncomputed. This study has been extended by P. Li and Wang and brought to its\nnatural limit for the case of periodic elliptic operators on co-compact abelian\ncoverings by P. Kuchment and Pinchover.\n  Comparison of the results and techniques of Nadirashvili and Gromov and\nShubin with those of Kuchment and Pinchover shows significant similarities, as\nwell as appearance of the same combinatorial expressions in the answers. Thus a\nnatural idea was considered that possibly the results could be combined somehow\nin the case of co-compact abelian coverings, if the infinity is \"added to the\ndivisor.\"\n  This work shows that such results indeed can be obtained, although they come\nout more intricate than a simple-minded expectation would suggest. Namely, the\ninteraction between the finite divisor and the point at infinity is\nnon-trivial."}, "authors": [{"name": "Minh Kha"}, {"name": "Peter Kuchment"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Peter Kuchment"}, "author": "Peter Kuchment", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13386v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13386v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "math.SP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "math.SP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.AP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.MP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "35B53, 35P99, 58J05 (Primary), 35J99, 35Q40, 19L10 (Secondary)", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12205v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12205v1", "updated": "2020-07-23T18:28:21Z", "updated_parsed": [2020, 7, 23, 18, 28, 21, 3, 205, 0], "published": "2020-07-23T18:28:21Z", "published_parsed": [2020, 7, 23, 18, 28, 21, 3, 205, 0], "title": "Dispersion relations and spectra of periodically perforated structures", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Dispersion relations and spectra of periodically perforated structures"}, "summary": "We establish absolute continuity of the spectrum of a periodic Schr\\\"odiner\noperator in R^n with periodic perforations.

We conclude that this difficulty, as in the first part of the paper,\nstems from the use of specific coordinates in a Grassmannian and show how to\navoid it to extend some of the consequent results to the general situation."}, "authors": [{"name": "Peter Kuchment"}, {"name": "Jia Zhao"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Jia Zhao"}, "author": "Jia Zhao", "arxiv_doi": "10.1063/1.5110193", "links": [{"title": "doi", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5110193", "rel": "related", "type": "text/html"}, {"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03035v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03035v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_comment": "Submitted", "arxiv_journal_ref": "Journal of Mathematical Physics, 2019", "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "math-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "math-ph", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.CA", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.MP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.SP", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "34B45, 35R02, 81Q35, 92E10, 94C15", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3456v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3456v1", "updated": "2007-08-26T00:52:43Z", "updated_parsed": [2007, 8, 26, 0, 52, 43, 6, 238, 0], "published": "2007-08-26T00:52:43Z", "published_parsed": [2007, 8, 26, 0, 52, 43, 6, 238, 0], "title": "Index theorems for quantum graphs", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Index theorems for quantum graphs"}, "summary": "In geometric analysis, an index theorem relates the difference of the numbers\nof solutions of two differential equations to the topological structure of the\nmanifold or bundle concerned, sometimes using the heat kernels of two\nhigher-order differential operators as an intermediary.

We use\nthe same approach to give an approximation of the Log preimage of the amoeba of\na Laurent polynomial using semi-algebraic sets. We also provide a SINGULAR/SAGE\nimplementation of these algorithms, which shows a significant speedup when our\nspecialized cyclic resultant computation is used, versus a general purpose\nresultant algorithm."}, "authors": [{"name": "Jens Forsg\u00e5rd"}, {"name": "Laura Felicia Matusevich"}, {"name": "Nathan Mehlhop"}, {"name": "Timo de Wolff"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Timo de Wolff"}, "author": "Timo de Wolff", "arxiv_comment": "Minor revision; final version; 15 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08663v3", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08663v3", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.SC", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.SC", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.AC", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.AG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "13P15, 14Q20, 14T05 (Primary), 90C59, 90C90 (Secondary)", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3846v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3846v1", "updated": "2008-03-27T00:51:30Z", "updated_parsed": [2008, 3, 27, 0, 51, 30, 3, 87, 0], "published": "2008-03-27T00:51:30Z", "published_parsed": [2008, 3, 27, 0, 51, 30, 3, 87, 0], "title": "Combinatorics of binomial primary decomposition", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Combinatorics of binomial primary decomposition"}, "summary": "An explicit lattice point realization is provided for the primary components\nof an arbitrary binomial ideal in characteristic zero.

An immediate corollary is that the corresponding\nLebesgue constant will be uniformly bounded with a constant whose only\ndependence on the set of data sites is reflected in the mesh ratio, which\nmeasures the uniformity of the data.\n  The analysis needed for these results was inspired by some fundamental work\nof Matveev where the Sobolev decay of Lagrange functions associated with\ncertain kernels on \\Omega \\subset R^d was obtained.

Our\nmain result is to show that these families coincide as braided tensor\ncategories using a recent theorem of Tuba and Wenzl. The morphism spaces in\nthese categories can be equipped with a Hermitian form, and we are able to show\nthat these categories are never unitary, and no braided tensor category sharing\nthe Grothendieck semiring common to these families is unitarizable."}, "authors": [{"name": "Eric C.

In our consequent paper, we plan\nto extend our flexible HDG framework to more challenging multiscale problems\nwith non-separable scales and high contrast and consider enriched coarse spaces\nthat use appropriate local spectral problems."}, "authors": [{"name": "Yalchin Efendiev"}, {"name": "Raytcho Lazarov"}, {"name": "Ke Shi"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Ke Shi"}, "author": "Ke Shi", "arxiv_comment": "27 pages, 2 figures", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2827v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2827v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "math.NA", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "math.NA", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "65N30", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1068v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1068v1", "updated": "2013-07-03T16:29:40Z", "updated_parsed": [2013, 7, 3, 16, 29, 40, 2, 184, 0], "published": "2013-07-03T16:29:40Z", "published_parsed": [2013, 7, 3, 16, 29, 40, 2, 184, 0], "title": "Error Analysis of Semidiscrete Finite Element Methods for Inhomogeneous\n  Time-Fractional Diffusion", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Error Analysis of Semidiscrete Finite Element Methods for Inhomogeneous\n  Time-Fractional Diffusion"}, "summary": "We consider the initial boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous\ntime-fractional diffusion equation with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary\ncondition and a nonsmooth right hand side data in a bounded convex polyhedral\ndomain.

We show\nthat, for $H=QSym$, the generalized Dehn-Sommerville relations are the\nBayer-Billera relations and the odd subalgebra is the peak Hopf algebra of\nStembridge. We prove that $QSym$ is the product (in the categorical sense) of\nits even and odd Hopf subalgebras. We also calculate the odd subalgebras of\nvarious related combinatorial Hopf algebras: the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf\nalgebra of permutations, the Loday-Ronco Hopf algebra of planar binary trees,\nthe Hopf algebras of symmetric functions and of non-commutative symmetric\nfunctions."}, "authors": [{"name": "Marcelo Aguiar"}, {"name": "Nantel Bergeron"}, {"name": "Frank Sottile"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Frank Sottile"}, "author": "Frank Sottile", "arxiv_doi": "10.1112/S0010437X0500165X", "links": [{"title": "doi", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1112/S0010437X0500165X", "rel": "related", "type": "text/html"}, {"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0310016v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0310016v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_comment": "34 pages", "arxiv_journal_ref": "Compositio Mathematica, 142, January 2006, 1--30", "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "math.CO", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "math.CO", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.QA", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "math.RA", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "05A15, 05E05, 06A11, 16W30, 16W50", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06793v2", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06793v2", "updated": "2017-01-23T15:49:09Z", "updated_parsed": [2017, 1, 23, 15, 49, 9, 0, 23, 0], "published": "2016-09-22T01:19:38Z", "published_parsed": [2016, 9, 22, 1, 19, 38, 3, 266, 0], "title": "Injectivity of generalized Wronski maps", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Injectivity of generalized Wronski maps"}, "summary": "We study linear projections on Pluecker space whose restriction to the\nGrassmannian is a non-trivial branched cover.
