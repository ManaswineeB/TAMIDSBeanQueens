    "The list it'll load will have repeated entries and it may even have some garbage data, namely some publincations listed there may be may be of someone not related to A&M. To cleanup the repeated entry I think you can make the list a set and then convert it back into a list, and that should remove repetations. To clean up the ghost entries, I don't know how I'd do that."
