An\ninformation-theoretic formulation of the problem is presented. A coding scheme\nthat combines rate splitting, superposition coding, nested binning and channel\nprefixing is considered and is shown to achieve the secrecy capacity region of\nthe channel in several scenarios. Specifying these results to both scalar and\nindependent parallel Gaussian channels (under an average individual\nper-subchannel power constraint), it is shown that the high-security message\ncan be embedded into the low-security message at full rate (as if the\nlow-security message does not exist) without incurring any loss on the overall\nrate of communication (as if both messages are low-security messages).\nExtensions to the wiretap channel II setting of Ozarow and Wyner are also\nconsidered, where it is shown that \"perfect\" security embedding can be achieved\nby an encoder that uses a two-level coset code."}, "authors": [{"name": "Hung D.

Based on this distribution, the mean\nhitting time to an empty queue and delay-violation probabilities for specific\nthresholds can be computed explicitly. The proposed techniques apply to\nsituations where the transmit buffer contains a predetermined number of\ninformation bits at the onset of the data transfer. Furthermore, as additional\nperformance criteria, large deviation principles are obtained for the empirical\nmean service time and the average packet-transmission time associated with the\ncommunication process. This rigorous framework yields a pragmatic methodology\nto select code rate and block length for the communication unit as functions of\nthe service requirements.

In this\npaper, we present a rate-distortion (R-D) approach to analyze these\nmultiple-decoding algorithms for RS codes. This approach is first used to\nunderstand the asymptotic performance-versus-complexity trade-off of multiple\nerror-and-erasure decoding of RS codes. By defining an appropriate distortion\nmeasure between an error pattern and an erasure pattern, the condition for a\nsingle error-and-erasure decoding to succeed reduces to a form where the\ndistortion is compared to a fixed threshold. Finding the best set of erasure\npatterns for multiple decoding trials then turns out to be a covering problem\nwhich can be solved asymptotically by rate-distortion theory. Next, this\napproach is extended to analyze multiple algebraic soft-decision (ASD) decoding\nof RS codes. Both analytical and numerical computations of the R-D functions\nfor the corresponding distortion measures are discussed. Simulation results\nshow that proposed algorithms using this approach perform better than other\nalgorithms with the same complexity."}, "authors": [{"name": "Phong S. Nguyen"}, {"name": "Henry D.

In this paper, we aim to remove the barrier by developing\nthe first programming framework AutoMTL that automates MTL model development.\nAutoMTL takes as inputs an arbitrary backbone convolutional neural network and\na set of tasks to learn, then automatically produce a multi-task model that\nachieves high accuracy and has small memory footprint simultaneously. As a\nprogramming framework, AutoMTL could facilitate the development of MTL-enabled\ncomputer vision applications and even further improve task performance.

We show how this problem can be looked at as a network\ngeneralization of the Ozarow-Wyner Wiretap Channel of type II. In particular,\nwe show that network security can be achieved by using the Ozarow-Wyner\napproach of coset coding at the source on top of the implemented network code.\nThis way, we quickly and transparently recover some of the results available in\nthe literature on secure network coding for wiretapped networks.

This comprises sources that were\ndetected on monthly time intervals during the first decade of Fermi-LAT\noperations. The monthly time scale allows us to identify transient and variable\nsources that were not yet reported in other Fermi-LAT catalogs. The monthly\ndatasets were analyzed using a wavelet-based source detection algorithm that\nprovided the candidate new transient sources. The search was limited to the\nextragalactic regions of the sky to avoid the dominance of the Galactic diffuse\nemission at low Galactic latitudes. The transient candidates were then analyzed\nusing the standard Fermi-LAT Maximum Likelihood analysis method. All sources\ndetected with a statistical significance above 4$\\sigma$ in at least one\nmonthly bin were listed in the final catalog. The 1FLT catalog contains 142\ntransient $\\gamma$-ray sources that are not included in the 4FGL-DR2 catalog.\nMany of these sources (102) have been confidently associated with Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN): 24 are associated with Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars; 1\nwith a BL Lac object; 70 with Blazars of Uncertain Type; 3 with Radio Galaxies;\n1 with a Compact Steep Spectrum radio source; 1 with a Steep Spectrum Radio\nQuasar; 2 with AGN of other types. The remaining 40 sources have no candidate\ncounterparts at other wavelengths. The median $\\gamma$-ray spectral index of\nthe 1FLT-AGN sources is softer than that reported in the latest Fermi-LAT AGN\ngeneral catalog.
