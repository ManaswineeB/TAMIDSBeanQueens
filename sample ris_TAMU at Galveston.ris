N2  - The growing incorporation of renewable energy sources into the traditional utility system has led to the development of microgrids to efficiently supply power to areas localized at the renewable sources. Similar systems are being developed for power distribution on future navy ships to effectively incorporate advanced systems requiring DC power, though such systems do not contain renewable energy resources, they do however contain load structures that present major challenges to grid stability and functionality. These DC microgrids for naval applications thus require management of power flow throughout the system, and therefore require advanced controls to accurately regulate and stabilize the systems during changing operational conditions. Therefore, adaptive droop control is proposed as a power management layer for these DC microgrids. This method uses adaptation of the controller parameters to account for uncertainty and changes in the system to accurately regulate the power sharing among distributed generation sources and to stabilize the bus voltage of the system. The proposed method is applied to a notional medium voltage direct current (MVDC) ship power system and demonstrated through an operational scenario to test the effectiveness of the control algorithm utilizing controller hardware in the loop.

N2  - <jats:p>In June, 1945, America's Communists replaced their leader, Earl Browder, who had sought an East-West détente instead of the Cold War. Eight months later they expelled him from the movement altogether, although he had spent twenty-four years in its service. Since 1934, when he had gained undisputed control, he had dominated the Communist party of the United States (CPUSA) “as no one had done before or could do afterward.” Under him it had taken advantage of the Great Depression to achieve a degree of respectability previously unknown. It even enjoyed “a measure of prestige in at least some sections of society.” Probably the best-organized political party to the left of the New Deal, during the thirties it also became the largest Marxian group by outdistancing the socialists. The CPUSA grew in number from 7,000 in 1930 to about 100,000 during the Second World War, with influence ranging far beyond its membership rolls. In contrast to its success under Browder, after his ouster it receded rapidly into political oblivion.</jats:p>

ER  - 

TY  - JOUR

N2  - Glycine is taken up twice as rapidly by neurons R3-R14 as by other identified neurons in the Aplysia parietovisceral ganglion. Earlier studies had shown that R3-R14 have much higher glycine concentrations than other Aplysia neurons. Most of the glycine taken up by R3-R14 was biochemically untransformed for at least 1 h following its uptake. Glycine is actively transported into into R3-R14 and other Aplysia neurons by carrier-mediated processes. Glycine uptake by R3-R14 was markedly reduced in the absence of Na+ and in the presence of Hg2+, while these treatments had little effect on glycine uptake by other Aplysia neurons. There appears to be a special glycine uptake system present in R3-R14 and a general glycine uptake system common to all Aplysia neurons. The elevated glycine concentrations and special glycine uptake associated with R3-R14 may indicate that glycine is utilized as a neurotransmitter by those neurons.

N2  - <jats:p>Bermuda's caves have proven to be extremely valuable from the scientific, economic, and recreational, viewpoints. Significant studies in geology, palaeontology, and biology, have been conducted in these caves, which are also an important asset as tourist attractions in a country whose economy is almost wholly dependent upon tourism. Caves and other karst landforms contribute much to the scenic beauty of Bermuda. However, a number of these caves have been destroyed or severely damaged by Man. The four primary threats to Bermuda's caves have been (1) filling and quarrying activities, (2) water pollution, (3) dumping and littering, and (4) vandalism.</jats:p>

N2  - Copyright © 1979. Offshore Technology Conference.  An area of extensive gas seepage has been found on the South Texas shelf. The seep area extends for a distance of approximately 25 miles on a transect out from the coast at latitude 26° 10'N. Water depths range between 65 and 130 meters. During nine samplings over a three year period, elevated near-bottom concentrations of methane (up to 500 nl/L), ethane (0.6 nl/L), and propane (0.5 nl/L) compared to nearby surface and other near-bottom waters were observed. Anomalous gaseous hydrocarbon levels were also observed in the interstitial waters at three stations sampled in the region. Ethane and propane concentrations were typically one order of magnitude higher in these sediments compared to typical South Texas shelf sediments. The C 1 /(C 2 +C 3 ) ratios in the sediments were as low as 14 indicating that the seepage may be of a petrogenic origin and not from shallow biogenic (microbial) sources. Significantly higher percentages of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria were observed in the seep area. These may be a direct result of hydrocarbon seepage. No anomalous interstitial gas concentrations were observed in the 'Serendipity Gas Seep Area' of South Texas.

N2  - The Orca Basin is a hypersaline depression in the northern Gulf of Mexico with anoxic conditions observed in the lower 200 m of the water column. Measurements of adenosine 5'-triphosphate, heterotrophic potential, and uridine uptake made above and across the interface into the anoxic zone revealed the presence of an active microbial population approximately 100 m above the interface. Biomass and activity decreased at and just below the interface but increased near the bottom, consistent with similar observations made in the Cariaco Trench. The maximum adenosine 5'-triphosphate concentration above the interface of 5.9 ng/liter (2,173 m) is about eight times greater than the value found in oxygenated waters of corresponding depth in the absence of an anoxic zone. The maximum adenosine 5'-triphosphate concentration in the anoxic zone is approximately 15 times greater than that found in oxygenated water of similar depth, suggesting anoxia will support the development of a larger bacterial population. Our findings suggest that autotrophic bacteria may be the dominant physiological group in the region just above the interface.

N2  - Two crude oils, South Louisiana and Kuwait, were examined for their impact on glucose utilization by bacterial populations from the Gulf of Mexico. The uptake and mineralization of [U-C]glucose was assayed after a 4- to 23-h exposure to various concentrations of added crude oil (0, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1% [vol/vol]). The effects of oil were determined in a total of 15 sediment and 13 water samples collected from offshore, open-bay, and salt marsh environments. The utilization of glucose by bacterial populations usually was not affected by added oil; in 10 sediment and 11 water samples, oil had no significant effect on either glucose uptake or mineralization. Stimulation by oil was recorded in four sediment samples. Oil inhibition occurred in one sediment and two water samples, but only in the presence of the highest concentration of added oil, i.e., 0.1%. Our data suggest that short-term exposure to either South Louisiana or Kuwait crude oil, even at 0.1%, usually has no toxic effect on glucose utilization by marine bacterial populations.

N2  - Natural dives are usually short and aerobic, involving swimming effort that is not energetically costly. Present evidence indicates few, if any, major biochemical enzyme adaptations that would promote an extended anaerobic capacity in marine mammals. We have discussed the lack of evidence for unusual biochemical adaptations for anaerobiosis and the importance and characteristics of natural aerobic dives. What explanation can we offer for the known capability of some marine mammals, such as Weddell seals and sperm whales, to remain submerged for over an hour? Attributes that serve them well for shorter dives are important also for long dives, such as: (a) a large total oxygen store relative to body size, and (b) parsimonious use of blood oxygen due to the lowered energy requirements of various organs. During long dives, some organs deplete their oxygen stores, become predominately dependent on anaerobic metabolism, and build up large quantities of lactate. The result is a degree of fatigue that leaves the animal incapable of further intense diving activities for some time. Consequently, long anaerobic dives are quite rare in nature.

N2  - During 4- to 8-day periods at sea, half of 2595 dives of three king penguins were more than 50 meters and two dives exceeded 240 meters. The at-sea metabolic rate, estimated from the turnover of tritiated water, was 2.8 times the standard metabolic rate and requires about 2.5 kilograms of squid per day. Ten percent or less of the dives may result in prey capture.

N2  - Romania is divided into 5 biospeleological provinces based upon the present distribution of the endemic troglobitic and edaphobitic fauna. Ancestors of this fauna migrated into Romania primarily from the north Aegean region probably at various times during the Tertiary Age. Four paleographic barriers - the corridors of the Danube, Timis-Cerna, Olt, and Mures Rivers - acted to constrain the migration routes and settlement areas, thus producing distinct patterns in the distribution of the cave fauna in the Carpathians. The present day terrestrial troglobitic fauna of Romania consists of 208 known species and subspecies, including 126 Coleoptera, 23 Araneae, 20 Diplopoda, 12 Collembola, 8 Pseudoscorpiones, and 6 Isopoda. Over 97% of these troglobitic taxa are endemic, and >80% are paleotroglobitic. -Authors

N2  - Renal and hepatic function were studied during voluntary dives in Weddell seals by measuring the clearance rate of inulin and indocyanine green (ICG). Inulin is cleared exclusively by the kidneys and measures renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). ICG is cleared by the liver and is blood flow dependent at concentrations used. Studies were conducted from a portable hut with a trapdoor placed over an isolated hole in the sea ice near McMurdo Station, Antarctica. An intravertebral extradural catheter was inserted percutaneously under light anesthesia in subadult seals weighing 130-200 kg. When released into the ice hole, the seals made voluntary dives, but always had to return to breathe. Serial blood samples were taken after single injections of inulin and ICG and analyzed within 24 h. The mean half time (t 1/2) for inulin clearance while resting at the surface was 27.3 +/- 13.0 min (n = 43) and the mean t 1/2 for ICG clearance was 18.3 +/- 7.3 min (n = 23). The mean resting GFR was 3.6 ml X min-1 X kg-1 (range 3.2-3.9, n = 3). Inulin and ICG clearance rates did not change from resting levels during dives shorter than the seal's aerobic dive limit (ADL). Inulin clearance decreased over 90% during dives longer than the ADL, but there was no significant reduction in ICG clearance during dives lasting up to 23 min. It appears that normal renal GFR and hepatic blood flow continue during natural aerobic dives. During dives that exceed the ADL, GFR is reduced but hepatic blood flow may be maintained.

N2  - An assemblage of endemic cavernicolous marine invertebrates, including taxa found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean of great phylogenetic age or with affinities to deep sea organisms, inhabits the Jameos del Agua cave, a sea waterflooded Holocene lava tube cave on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. This marine cave contains both relicts from Tethyan times, such as an apparently new crustacean family belonging to what had been the monotypic class Remipedia, and relicts of groups that are now common only in the deep sea as well as species that occur outside the cave.

In this paper we prove that under some conditions a selfadjoint completely bounded linear map with a unique minimal decomposition is equivalent to the map with a unique commutant representation (up to unitary equivalence).

N2  - <jats:p> Radiotracer experiments were carried out in 20 enclosures located in two lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), northwestern Ontario, to study pathways of trace metal removal from the water column of shallow lakes. Two removal mechanisms were characterized: (1) sorption to and subsequent transport with falling particles and (2) direct adsorption to surface sediments. Our approach was to measure independently the kinetics of radiotracer sorption, fluxes and concentrations for particles, particle settling velocities, and the "equivalent stagnant boundary film." Our radiotracer results enabled us to test the sensitivity of the tracer removal rates on these rate-determining processes using a numerical transport model. Acid titrations of whole ecosystems revealed that some trace metals (e.g. Mn, Co, and Zn) can diffuse back to the water column as the pH is lowered from 6.5 to 4.8 after 18 d, while others remain tightly bound (e.g. Sn, Fe, Se, Cr, Ag, and Hg isotopes). Subsequent CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> additions to bring back the pH to its original value restored the initial removal conditions for acid-sensitive radiotracers, indicating that the pH sensitivity is reversible. Transport parameters for particle-related pathways or diffusive pathways across the sediment–water interface obtained from our enclosure experiments were used to predict the removal rates of "particle-reactive" <jats:sup>60</jats:sup>Co and the "diffusive" pathway tracer <jats:sup>134</jats:sup>Cs observed in earlier experiments where radiotracers were added to whole lakes or to larger enclosures. </jats:p>

N2  - Anchialine caves occur as flooded lava tube caves or as solutional caves submerged by rising sea levels or by land subsidence. A suitably preadapted species would first colonize the entrance zone of a marine cave. Subsequent migration farther into the cave could result from the expansive nature of the species. Genetic isolation of the cave population, could occur. Dispersal and isolation would be accompanied by gradual evolutionary adaptation. In the environmentally stable but food-poor inner reaches of the cave, nutritional strategies would be a prime factor in determining survival. Open inland pools would provide plentiful food resources. Upward invasion of these pools would require further adaptation to the brackish or even fresh surface waters typically encountered in the anchialine habitat. A final step would involve dispersal from these inland pools to completely fresh water cave systems.-from Author

N2  - <jats:p> Radiotracer experiments were carried out in enclosures in two lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area, North-western Ontario, to study the pathways of trace metal removal from the shallow water columns to the sediments of these lakes. As part of the larger experiment, stable carriers of Fe, Mn, and Zn were added individually to each of three enclosures. Rates of removal to sediments at pH 6.3 and backdiffusion after HCl addition to pH 4.8 of radiotracer <jats:sup>59</jats:sup>Fe, <jats:sup>54</jats:sup>Mn, and <jats:sup>65</jats:sup>Zn were compared to the respective rates of their stable counterparts. Tracer removal and backdiffusion rates in enclosures which received stable carrier additions were further compared with the tracer behaviour in enclosures which received no carrier additions. Radiotracers and stable carriers were removed from the water column at similar rates at pH 6.3, and were remobilized at similar rates from the sediments when the pH of the water column was lowered to 4.8. The presence of the added stable carriers had no effect on the removal or remobilization of Mn or Zn. However, the removal of <jats:sup>59</jats:sup>Fe from the water column was slowed slightly by the addition of Fe(III) carrier compared to removal in the other tubes, possibly due to the formation of colloidal phases. These results show that information on the rates of trace metal transport obtained using radiotracers is applicable to stable metal behavior in these freshwater systems. The use of radiotracers to study trace metal geochemistry under natural conditions is preferred to the addition of stable metals which may alter the physical and chemical properties of the suspended particulate matter as occurred after the addition of stable iron. Speciation studies showed that adsorption to ion exchange resins does not provide a reliable indication of the ionic form of metals in lake water. </jats:p>

N2  - The purpose of this study was to develop a method to clean and rehabilitate sea otters (Enhydra lutris) that might become contaminated during an oil spill and to determine which physiological and behavioral factors were important in restoring the insulation provided by the fur. Tests were conducted on 12 sea otters captured in Alaska and brought to the Sea World Research Institute in San Diego. Measurements of average metabolic rate, core body temperature, behavior, and squalene (the major lipid of sebum) concentration on the fur were made under three conditions: (i) before oiling (base line), (ii) 1-3 days after 20% of the body surface area was covered with fresh crude oil, and (iii) after cleaning. Under base-line conditions in water at 13°C, average metabolic rate was 8.0 W/kg, core body temperature was 38.9°C, and whole body thermal conductance was 10.7 W/(m2· °C). Otters spent 35% of their time grooming, 45% resting, 10% swimming, and 10% feeding. The squalene concentration on the fur averaged 3.7 mg/g fur. Oiling increased thermal conductance 1.8 times. To compensate for the loss of insulation and maintain a normal core body temperature (39°C), the otters increased average metabolic rate (1.9 times) through voluntary activity and shivering; the time spent grooming and swimming increased 1.7 times. Using Dawn detergent, we were able to clean the oiled fur during 40 min of washing and rinsing. Grooming activity by the otters was essential for restoring the water-repellent quality of the fur. Core body temperature, average metabolic rate, and thermal conductance returned to base-line levels 3-6 days after cleaning. Squalene was removed by cleaning and did not return to normal levels in the oiled area after 7 days. Veterinary care was important to keep the otters healthy. At least 1-2 weeks should be allowed for otters to restore the insulation of their fur and for recovery from the stress of oiling and cleaning.

N2  - <jats:p> The contamination of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) fur with crude oil or dispersants reduces its insulation and could subject the animal to hypothermia. This study tested methods for removing crude oil from sea otter pelts, and measured changes in insulation caused by oil contamination and subsequent cleaning. Four detergents and two pretreatments were tested on sea otter pelts soiled with fresh crude, 5-day weathered crude, and an oil–dispersant (COREXIT 9527) solution. To examine the effects of oiling and cleaning on the thermal properties of the fur, the thermal conductance of untreated, oiled, and cleaned pelt samples was determined with a heat-flow transducer. Changes in lipid concentration in the fur resulting from contamination and cleaning were also assessed. The results demonstrated that Dawn dishwashing detergent was the most effective agent in removing crude oil from sea otter fur. This detergent removed similar amounts of oil with 15 or 40 °C rinse water, and was less effective when used in conjunction with mineral oil or soap pretreatments. Oil contamination caused a two- to four-fold increase in thermal conductance over base-line levels (7.64 ± 1.30 W/(m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>∙ °C)). Following cleaning, the thermal conductance of the pelt was not significantly different from that of untreated fur. However, mean lipid weight decreased from 7.4 mg lipid/g fur in untreated pelts to 2.0 mg lipid/g fur in cleaned pelts. This study demonstrated that even though natural oils may be lost during the cleaning process, proper cleaning and rinsing restores the water repellency of the sea otter pelt after exposure to crude oil. </jats:p>

N2  - Of all the geochemical boundaries, the sediment-water interface an exert the greatest control on the cycling of many elements in shallow aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal embayments and, to a lesser extent in the deep sea. Across this interface, the gradients in physical properties (i.e. density), in chemical conditions (i.e. pH, pE, ligand concentrations), biota abundance (i.e. fauna and flora living near the interface) are large, thus producing potentially large fluxes. Some of the physical, chemical, biological and sedimentary controls operating at or near these interfaces can be deciphered from the measurements of natural radioisotopes (e.g. U/Th series or cosmic-ray produced), bomb fallout isotopes or, most recently, fallout from the Chernobyl-reactor accident. Commercially available, reactor-produced isotopes are most often used in enclosures to elucidate the coupling of the various processes at the sediment-water interface, while the former are used both as geochronological tools in the sediments and as tracers to measure or calibrate the rates of exchange across this interface of nutrients or trace elements associated with water or particles. Applications of radioisotopes for studying biological, physical, chemical and sedimentary processes near the sediment-water interface are discussed. In particular, multitracer approaches to study the dynamic coupling of physical, chemical and biological transport processes in lakes are emphasized. Examples from two hard-water lakes in Switzerland, Lake Biel and Lake Zürich, give evidence for the resuspension of fine ('rebound') particles, radionuclides and trace metals from the horizontal boundaries focussing them to their final repositories in the interior of the lake. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

N2  - An apparatus developed at Texas A&M Department of Oceanography facilitates the in-situ filtration of up to 12 large-volume seawater samples. MIPS (multisample pumping system) is an enhancement of an earlier six-channel large-volume filtration system (Orr, Guinasso, and Schink, 1984). The system is enclosed in a 5-ft-diameter by 3-ft cylindrical frame deployable by itself or under a Niskin bottle rosette. Nominally, MIPS consists of a battery-powered Jacuzzi pump, a manifold containing 12 valves, three or six deep discharge 12-V batteries, a differential pressure sensor, a flow sensor, an underwater control unit, and a computer terminal as a deck unit. The inside of the frame is equipped with unistrut bars for mounting filtration cartridges or flat press-type filter holders. MIPS requires a single conductor hydrographic cable for deck control of the filtration process. The pump and pressure sensor are designed for a maximum pumping pressure of 50 psi. Pump speed is adjustable to maintain the desired system pressure throughout each operation of the pump.

N2  - To determine the effect of temperature and pH on oxygen-hemoglobin affinity of the harbor seal, we measured 61 biotonometric oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curves on blood from 5 seals at 3 temperatures and a range of pH values. The average (+/- SEM) hemoglobin concentration was 3.44 +/- 0.15 mM, nearly 50% greater than found in normal humans. At pH 7.4 the P50 (partial pressure of O2 at 50% hemoglobin saturation) +/- SEM values were 22.4 +/- 0.6,25.3 +/- 0.5, and 28.5 +/- 0.4 Torr at 33, 37 and 41 degrees C, respectively. The effect of temperature on oxygen-hemoglobin affinity, (delta log P50/delta T) was 0.014 +/- 0.001 at pH 7.4, significantly lower than that observed in human and dog blood. This low temperature sensitivity may facilitate oxygen off-loading from hemoglobin when temperature gradients exist within the animal or as tissue temperature decreases during a dive. Temperature did not significantly affect the Hill coefficient 'n' (shape) of the dissociation curve which averaged 2.43 +/- 0.04 at 37 degrees C. The fixed-acid Bohr coefficient (delta log P50/delta pH) was -0.606 +/- 0.032 at 37 degrees C and increased with temperature. This relatively large value for the Bohr coefficient was similar to those previously reported for the Northern Elephant, Bladdernose, and Weddell Seals, and may facilitate oxygen off-loading as acidosis develops during a dive.

N2  - Progressive ankylosis mice (ank/ank) spontaneously develop a joint disorder characterized by calcium hydroxyapatite deposition and bony ankylosis of the joints of the axial and the appendicular skeleton. Mice in this study were used to determine the extent of mineralization of the intervertebral disks and to determine their suitability as a model for ankylosing spondyloarthropathies. Intervertebral disks taken from affected mice from 4 to 18 weeks of age were studied by electron-microscopic, electron energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis and selected-area electron diffraction techniques. Necrotic foci seen in light microscope studies were found to be massive accumulations of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals deposited within the extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes of older animals demonstrated what appeared to be postmortem changes and contained numerous large vacuoles.

N2  - We have examined the apolipoprotein content of the lipoproteins of several marine mammals by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their apolipoprotein (apo) B-100, apoB-48, and apoA-I migrated to virtually the same position as the comparable human apolipoproteins. In cetaceans (bottlenose dolphins and killer whales), the molecular mass of the apoE was identical to that of human apoE (35 kDa). In contrast, in the lipoproteins of pinnipeds (harbor seals, sea lions, and walrus) there was no protein comparable in size to human apoE; however, there were two proteins in the 40- to 44-kDa range. The protein with the higher apparent molecular weight (44 kDa) was apoA-IV, as determined by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. Sequencing of the NH2-terminal 15 amino acids of the lower molecular weight protein (40-42 kDa) revealed no obvious homology with human apoE. However, a human apoE-specific monoclonal antibody, 1D7, bound to the 40- to 42-kDa protein, allowing us to identify that protein as apoE. Sequencing of sea lion apoE cDNA clones demonstrated that sea lion apoE is 311 amino acids in length, 12 residues longer than human apoE. All 12 additional residues are located in the NH2-terminal 31 amino acids, a region that has extremely low homology with the NH2-terminal portion of human apoE. The remainder of the sea lion apoE sequence is 74% homologous to human apoE. The sea lion apoE cDNA was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as well as CHO ldlD cells, a cell line that is deficient in O-glycosylation of proteins. The size of the sea lion apoE secreted by these two cell lines, compared with the apoE in sea lion plasma, indicated that the predominant form of apoE in sea lion plasma must be posttranslationally modified. Thus, our studies have demonstrated that the higher apparent molecular weight of pinniped (sea lion) apoE is due to a longer polypeptide chain as well as posttranslational modification of the protein.

N2  - 1. The turnover rates and oxidation rates of plasma glucose, lactate, and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured in three harbor seals (average mass = 40 kg) at rest or during voluntary submerged swimming in a water flume at 35% (1.3 m.s-1) and 50% (2 m.s-1) of maximum oxygen consumption (MO2max). 2. For seals resting in water, the total turnover rates for glucose, lactate, and FFA were 23.2, 26.2, and 7.5 mumols.min-1.kg-1, respectively. Direct oxidation of these metabolites accounted for approximately 7%, 27%, and 33% of their turnover and 3%, 7%, and 18% of the total ATP production, respectively. 3. For swimming seals, MO2max was achieved at a drag load equivalent to a speed of 3 m.s-1 and averaged 1.85 mmol O2.min-1.kg-1, which is 9-fold greater than resting metabolism in water at 18 degrees C. 4. At 35% and 50% MO2max, glucose turnover and oxidation rates did not change from resting levels. Glucose oxidation contributed about 1% of the total ATP production during swimming. 5. At 50% MO2max, lactate turnover and anaerobic ATP production doubled, but the steady state plasma lactate concentration remained low at 1.1 mM. Lactate oxidation increased 63% but still contributed only 4% of the total ATP production. Anaerobic metabolism contributed about 1% of the total ATP production at rest and during swimming. 6. The plasma FFA concentration and turnover rate increased only 24% and 37% over resting levels, respectively, at 50% MO2max. However, the oxidation rate increased almost 3.5-fold and accounted for 85% of the turnover.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - Liquid chromatographic analyses of extracts from shellfish and phytoplankton from the Gulf of Mexico indicated the presence of the marine toxins okadaic acid (0.162 microgram/g shellfish) and domoic acid (2.1 pg/cell phytoplankter). These toxins are causative agents of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), respectively. The presence of DSP and ASP toxins in a region with no previous record of outbreaks may indicate a potential for human poisoning under conditions appropriate for accumulation of these toxins in shellfish.

N2  - <jats:p> Arctic ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and antarctic Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli) were tracked using an attached acoustic tag during their under-ice movements at isolated experimental sites with varying numbers of novel breathing holes. Both natural and artificial visual landmarks were used by the seals during their dives. Seals deprived of vision through blindfolding greatly restricted their diving. Blindfolded seals responded to supplied acoustic cues and moved toward them. Prior to swimming toward an acoustic cue, the animals often swam at an angle to the direct line to the source of the acoustic cue. This movement could have provided information on the distance to the source of the sound. After executing this presumed ranging behavior, the seals swam directly toward the acoustic cue up to 4 km away. The contribution of vibrissal sensation to location of an open hole was investigated in blindfolded ringed seals. Seals farther than 1 m from an open hole were unable to find the hole without an acoustic cue. Vibrissal sensation apparently contributed to centering the blindfolded ringed seal within a breathing hole, but not to locating the hole. Weddell seals were able to maintain straight-line tracks for several hundred metres out from and back to a hole, were able to follow the same path on subsequent trips separated by up to 64 h, and continued using established routes between holes even though shorter, direct routes were available. The spatial memory implied by these observations is postulated to be a mechanism by which seals are able to move from one breathing hole to another under ice during dark polar winters. </jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p> Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron oxyhydroxide profiles were used to explain the retention of Hg in sediments of natural lakes and flooded soils in Quebec. In lake sediments, Hg levels increased from background concentrations of approximately 100 ng/g beneath the 10- to 16-cm depth interval to 150–490 ng/g near the surface. This increase was attributed to atmospheric inputs to the environment. In forest soils, the close association of Hg with the surficial organic horizon appears to be a potential source of contamination for the aquatic system through the transport of particulate matter by surface runoff. High organic matter content observed in the flooded soil of LG-2 Reservoir suggests that postsedimentation biodegradation is a slow process. In contrast, at Cabonga Reservoir, an 80% reduction in C, N, and Hg concentrations was observed between the flooded and the adjacent forest soil. Mechanical erosion processes (marling, waves, ice) rather than biodegradation seem responsible for the observed loss in C, N, and Hg. We propose that suspension of the humic horizon from flooded soils could constitute a significant source of Hg contamination to the overlying waters and biota until the exposed littoral zone stabilizes. </jats:p>

N2  - The whole-person bag sampler (WPBS) is a human-baited drop-net mosquito trap for evaluating an individual's exposure to nuisance mosquitoes. A diagram of WPBS construction is given, with results from field tests. Trap operator exposures of 2, 4, and 8 min did not result in a corresponding increase in mosquitoes caught in the WPBS, although simultaneous captures using a sweep net or Nasci aspirator increased with the sample duration. The person baiting and operating the trap did not have a significant effect on number of mosquitoes captured. Taxonomic diversity of adult mosquitoes collected with WPBS and CO2-baited traps was similar, with Aedes vexans predominant in the study areas.

N2  - For randomly chosen residents of the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area, survey responses, reported bites, and observed defensive behaviors (e.g., brushing, swatting) for a 5-min period in their yard were compared with simultaneous mosquito counts from a human-baited drop-net trap 6 m from the resident. When mosquitoes trapped, reported bites, or observed behaviors per 5 min were 3 or more, the majority of respondents described the mosquito levels as greater than "moderate" and anticipated reduced outdoor time and/or possible repellent use. At 25 or more mosquitoes trapped, 11 or more reported bites, or 16 or more observed behaviors per 5 min, response was "bad", with most people anticipating a major reduction in outdoor time (without repellent), "probably" or "definitely" planning to use repellent, and anticipating some outdoor time loss even if using repellent. Levels of less than 3 mosquitoes trapped per 5 min were related to moderate annoyance in 20-45% of the population. Individual response was highly variable, and the personal and environmental covariates measured did not account for more than half the variability.

N2  - In several brains of the Florida manatee, Trichechus manatus latirostris, the architecture of caudal regions of cerebral cortex was examined in order to complete a map of cortical areas in the brain of this unique herbivore. Through observation of sections stained for Nissl substance, myelinated axons, acetylcholinesterase and cytochrome oxidase, we have identified 11 new cortical areas based on qualitative cytoarchitectural appearance and measurements of laminar thicknesses, for a total of 24 such cortical areas in manatee cerebral cortex. Some areas exhibit poorly differentiated laminae while in others there are 6 clearly demarcated layers, often with sublaminar organization. Some previously identified areas were found to extend into the region caudal to the vertically oriented lateral fissure. As in other mammalian brains, cortical areas in manatees are organized in concentric rings of allocortex, mesocortex, and isocortex. Putative functional roles have been assigned to most of the identified areas based on location, architecture, behavioral and anatomical considerations, and extrapolation from other taxa in which functional mapping has been done.

N2  - The major sources of plutonium isotopes in the environment are from nuclear weapons testing via global and close-in (debris) fallout, nuclear fuel reprocessing and fabrication plant effluents. Measurements of differences in the Pu isotopic ratios (239Pu/240Pu, 238Pu/239,240Pu and 241Pu/239,240Pu) have yielded information not only on the time horizons for sedimentary deposits but also on the sources of Pu. We have measured 238Pu, 239,240Pu and 137Cs concentrations in the surficial sediments of the Ob and Yenisey Rivers (Russia) and the Kara Sea. The downcore variations of 238Pu and 239,240Pu concentrations have also been measured in some sediment cores. A comparison of the sediment core inventories of 239,240Pu along with the 238Pu/239,240Pu activity ratios with those expected from global fallout at the study sites allows us to estimate the relative amounts of reactor-derived 238Pu and 239,240Pu from the dumped reactor sites in the study area. In surficial sediment samples, the 239,240Pu concentrations vary between 9.4 and 627 mBq kg-1, with a mean of 250 mBq kg-1. The 238Pu/239,240Pu activity ratios vary between 0.009 and 0.065 with an average value of 0.034 +/- 0.003. This range can be compared to the average 238Pu/239,240Pu activity ratio of 0.030 for the year 1993 from nuclear weapons testing and SNAP fallout obtained from soil studies, indicating very little additional sources of 238Pu to the sediments in the study area. In sediment cores, the maximum depths at which 239,240Pu was detected varied between 6 and 12 cm. These depths yield average apparent sedimentation rates in the coastal Kara Sea between 1.5 and 3.0 mm yr-1 (assuming Pu input since 1952, and no sediment mixing).

N2  - 7Be penetrative depth in undisturbed surface soil is within 4 mm. 7 Be activity shows exponential decrease with soil depth, which is expressed as a diffusion process. 7Be penetrative depth in undisturbed surface soil is apparently deeper in the fall (0.22-0.37 g cm-2) than in the spring (0.11-0.28 g cm-2) at the same site; Whereas, 7 Be apparent activity at the top of surface soil is higher in the spring (0.3-2.2 Bq g-1) than in the fall (0.2-0.5 Bq g1) at the same site. The 7Be inventory (189-544 Bq m-2) changes with both locations and seasons. Although the 7Be flux to the earth's surface increases with amount of precipitation, its maximum inventory in the soil profiles decreases to 30%-40% after the rainy period. Calculated by the diffusion equation, the erosion and accumulation rates of soil particles are agreeable with the observation in situ., which shows that the rates in fall are 1.5 times those in spring. The eroded soil particles almost all have been removed on the tablelands rather than transported into the drainage system. This indicates that the soil erosion process in the karst region is only partial transportation within a short distance. © 1996 SCIENCE PRESS,.

N2  - <jats:p>RNA:DNA ratios in individual red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) were measured in laboratory-reared larvae and juveniles (6-20 mm standard length; age 16-40 days) to assess the effects of growth, starvation, and diel periodicity on biochemical condition. RNA: DNA ratios were correlated positively with both absolute (mm day-1) and instantaneous (% day-1) growth rates. The effect of starvation was evaluated daily over 5 day periods at three ontogenetic stages (20, 30, and 40 days). Significant differences in RNA:DNA ratios of fed and starved larvae were observed and changes in biochemical condition were detected statistically within 1 to 2 days of food deprivation. RNA:DNA ratios decreased continuously over the entire 5 day starvation period, with relative reductions in RNA : DNA ratios decreasing with increasing age. Diel variations in RNA : DNA ratios were investigated in controlled (constant) and natural (cyclical) temperature environments over a 48 h period. RNA: DNA ratios were highest during daytime periods (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000 hours) and markedly reduced at night (0000, 0400 hours). Since RNA: DNA ratios from controlled and natural temperature treatments did not differ significantly, cyclical variations in temperature did not appear responsible for diel variations in biochemical condition. Findings from this study support the use of nucleic acids as reliable indices of growth and condition and suggest that RNA: DNA ratios are potentially suitable measures to assess the condition of wild-caught S. ocellatus.</jats:p>

N2  - Soil erosion in karst region of south China is one of the major environmental problems. Beryllium-7, produced by energetic cosmic rays, has been used to trace the geochemical process of the soil erosion. The study has shown that7Be activity profiles present a decreasing logarithmic pattern with soil depth. The maximum permeable depth of7Be is 2-5 mm in different seasons and locations, which is deeper in autumn than in spring. On the contrary, its apparent activity on boundary soil is higher in spring than in autumn. The7Be inventories in soil cores are higher in accumulative locations than in eroded one. Upper hills in the karst region are seriously eroded. Erosive intensity is higher in rainy periods than in dry ones. Influenced by the micromorphology and precipitation, the eroded particles accumulated in shallow basin after a short-distance transportation in winter and spring. However, in summer and autumn, they might be transported into drainage systems.

N2  - Heterobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) derivatives with a biotin terminus have been synthesized and characterized with respect to avidin binding. Unambiguous measurement of biotinyl and pyridyldithiopropionyl end groups was established by selecting suitable assays and introducing necessary modifications. Functional studies on the binding of biotin-PEG conjugates to avidin tetramers revealed much similarity to known biotin-spacer-peptide conjugates with 7-27 atom spacers: dissociation kinetics of the initially formed 4:1 complexes were multiexponential, the complex with 2 ligands per avidin dissociating rather slowly with half-times of approximately 2 days at 25 degrees C. The observed stability of 3:1 and 2:1 complexes with avidin is particularly significant since it allows exploitation of the additional advantages of PEG spacers, i.e. reduced steric strain in biotin-avidin-biotin bridges, reduced nonspecific adsorption of biotinylated probes and markers, and, especially, uncomparable fluorescence intensities of biotin-PEG-fluorophore conjugates as is demonstrated in the accompanying study (second of three papers in this issue).

N2  - Conventional biotin-fluorophore conjugates with approximately 14 atom spacers lose most of their fluorescence when binding to avidin or streptavidin, as is demonstrated in the present study. This explains the unusual fact that only biotinylated marker enzymes, but not fluorescent biotins, are regularly used in bioanalytic assays. Novel biotin-spacer-fluorophore conjugates are presented that retain intense fluorescence when binding to avidin or streptavidin. Preservation of fluorescence depends upon the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacers, which are shown not to interfere with biotin function. The observed absence of nonspecific interactions may also be attributed to the PEG chain. These novel fluorescent biotins are expected to be excellent new tools in fluorescence microscopy and related techniques.

N2  - Conventional biotin-fluorophore conjugates with approximately 14 atom spacers are strongly quenched when bound to avidin or streptavidin, whereas fluorescence becomes insensitive to receptor binding if typical fluorophores are linked to biotin via poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains (Gruber et al., see the second of three papers in this issue). In the present study the antagonism between PEG-PEG repulsion and fluorophore interaction was examined more closely, using biotin-PEG-pyrene conjugates as model compounds. The antagonistic tendencies between hydrophilic PEG chains and hydrophobic pyrene labels were about balanced in the PEG1900 derivative since quenching was approximately 50% in 4:1 complexes with avidin or streptavidin. In contrast, strong quenching and concomitant excimer fluorescence was seen with the biotin-PEG800-pyrene conjugate, providing for a new fluorescence assay to accurately measure avidin and streptavidin concentrations at > or = 40 and > or = 10 nM, respectively. Association/ dissociation kinetics were analyzed from pyrene fluorescence changes, and dissociation constants were deduced. About 3-fold affinities were observed for streptavidin as compared to avidin, and little influence of PEG chain length was seen. All affinities were increased by a factor of approximately 3 when biotin-PEG-tetramethylrhodamine conjugates were used. The observed effect of fluorophore variation upon biotin binding is unexpectedly small; thus, the kinetic/thermodynamic data appear to be representative for biotin-PEG conjugates in general.

N2  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the largest organic carbon reservoir in sea water and plays an important role in the marine carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Accurate and precise determination of the DOC concentration in sea water is thus a prerequisite for any interpretation of DOC biogeochemistry. A key factor in analytical quality control is an accurate determination of the blank. The assessment and distinction of DOC blanks are essential for the precise measurements of oceanic DOC. The total DOC blank includes instrument and water blanks in the high temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) method. DOC can be measured accurately using the HTCO method only when the instrument blank is correctly distinguished from the total DOC blank and corrected in the sample measurements. Low DOC blanks can be achieved by extensive conditioning of new catalysts and the whole instrument system, whereas instrument blanks can be quantified by subtracting the water blank from the total DOC blank. We have been able to produce low carbon nanopure water [≤2μmol/dm3(C)] and have a low instrumental blank [<5-6 μmol/dm3(C)] when using the HTCO method. Results of concentrations and distributions of DOC in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic are oceanographically consistent. Results from DOC measurements on samples from the international DOC methods comparison program further confirmed our low values of both nanopure water and the instrument blank.

N2  - The distribution and concentration of muscle myoglobin is important in marine mammals as a source of oxygen during diving. A spectrophotometric analysis technique was used to determine myoglobin concentration. Samples were taken from fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus), harp seals (Phoca groenlandica), Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), a false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), a common dolphin (Delphinus delphinus), humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), a dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus ohscurus), a spotted dolphin (Stenella altenuata), a striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). The entire swimming muscle was removed, weighed, and subsampled for analysis. Cross sectional pieces of the muscle were subsampled using a circular grid of at least 35 sites. In cetaceans the muscles removed were the dorsal and the ventral longisimus; in otariids it was the pectoralis; and in phocids the langisimus was removed. Contour maps of myoglobin concentration were made for each animal using a PC based program S-plus (StatSci, Seattle). Myoglobin concentration was not uniformly distributed within the muscle. In the dolphin, the myogiobin gradient increased along the longisimus muscle from the cranial to the caudal end. The concentration also increased closer to the muscle attachment on the transverse processes and the neural spines of the vertebrae.

N2  - Photosynthesis is one of the most, if not THE most, important plant processes. The production of carbohydrates determines the ability of a plant to produce fruit and that is the ultimate goal of cotton production as a business. Many facets of crop management are, in reality, management of the photosynthetic factory. Interruption of the photosynthetic factory, due to some limiting factor (ie, water, nutrients, light), can greatly alter the plant's ability to produce and retain fruiting forms during the reproductive cycle. It is imperative, therefore, that we attain and enlarge a sound understanding of photosynthesis. The knowledge that we have in our grasp is small compared with what is to be learned. A multitude of researchable questions exist and include, how and why carbohydrate is stored within the plant, why photosynthetic patterns differ amongst years or how hormonal fluxes within the plant impact photosynthesis during growth. Molecular techniques provide a new tool for studying these questions. To do so, however, societal and political attitudes toward basic research must be altered.

N2  - Coastal surges along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula from extratropical storms were investigated using tide gage observations for one year and numerical model hindcasting. Positive surges were associated with smaller scale meteorological forcing than negative surges. Spatial and temporal variations among different locations characterized typical surge propagation from south to north along the west coast and from west to east across the Yellow Sea. Forecasting is feasible with meteorological forcing input with around 1°-1.5°spatial and 6 hourly temporal resolutions.

N2  - A new fluorimetric assay is presented for the specific and reliable quantitation of >/=2 nM avidin and streptavidin. The assay is based on pronounced changes in the fluorescence properties of commercial fluorescein-biotin, or of a newly synthesized biotin-poly(ethylene glycol)-pyrene conjugate, which occur upon binding to avidin and streptavidin. Accurate measurement of (strept)avidin in complex, colored biofluids, such as crude egg white or serum relies on a simple titration protocol. Only occasional recalibration of the reagent solution is required. Due to these merits the proposed assay is particularly suited for rapid measurement of few samples on short notice, for functional control of (strept)avidin-containing reagents after storage, and for the monitoring of (strept)avidin concentrations in large scale processes.

N2  - The hunting behavior of a marine mammal was studied beneath the Antarctic fast ice with an animal-borne video system and data recorder. Weddell seals stalked large Antarctic cod and the smaller subice fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki, often with the under-ice surface for backlighting, which implies that vision is important for hunting. They approached to within centimeters of cod without startling the fish. Seals flushed P. borchgrevinki by blowing air into subice crevices or pursued them into the platelet ice. These observations highlight the broad range of insights that are possible with simultaneous recordings of video, audio, three-dimensional dive paths, and locomotor effort.

N2  - A new biotin-carboxyfluorescein conjugate has been presented in the accompanying study (G. Kada et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 000 (1999) 000-000) which contains ethylene diamine as a 4-atom spacer. This so-called biotin-4-fluorescein showed exceptionally fast and tight binding to avidin and streptavidin, and binding was accompanied by strong quenching. In the present study the specific quenching of 'biotin-4-fluorescein' was utilized to measure (strept)avidin concentrations (0.2-2 nM) by the extent of fluorescence quenching at 8 nM ligand concentration. Adsorption of (strept)avidin to the assay tubes was suppressed by inclusion of bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml). Virtually the same specific response to avidin and streptavidin was also observed with commercial 'fluorescein-biotin', except that >10 h incubation times were required. The slow association of 'fluorescein-biotin' was attributed to the anti-cooperative binding which is due to the much longer spacer as compared to 'biotin-4-fluorescein'. The third ligand tested in this study was 'biotin-4-FITC' which was analogous to 'biotin-4-fluorescein' except that carboxyfluorescein was replaced by the fluorescein isothiocyanate residue. Surprisingly, this probe was much less quenched by avidin but this was compensated by an exceptionally high fluorescence polarization in the avidin-bound state. In conclusion, the new ligand 'biotin-4-fluorescein' appeared to be the most general and convenient probe: quenching was most pronounced and linearly dependent on (strept)avidin concentrations, the dose response for streptavidin was almost the same as for avidin, and the association kinetics were fast enough to reach equilibrium within 30 min incubation time.

N2  - The objective was to assess the aerobic capacity of skeletal muscles in pinnipeds. Samples of swimming and nonswimming muscles were collected from Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus, n = 27), Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus, n = 5), and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina, n = 37) by using a needle biopsy technique. Samples were either immediately fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde or frozen in liquid nitrogen. The volume density of mitochondria, myoglobin concentration, citrate synthase activity, and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was determined for all samples. The swimming muscles of seals had an average total mitochondrial volume density per volume of fiber of 9.7%. The swimming muscles of sea lions and fur seals had average mitochondrial volume densities of 6.2 and 8.8%, respectively. These values were 1.7- to 2.0-fold greater than in the nonswimming muscles. Myoglobin concentration, citrate synthase activity, and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were 1.1- to 2. 3-fold greater in the swimming vs. nonswimming muscles. The swimming muscles of pinnipeds appear to be adapted for aerobic lipid metabolism under the hypoxic conditions that occur during diving.

N2  - Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, marine mammals stop breathing and reduce their convective oxygen transport while performing activities (e.g. foraging, courtship, aggressive interactions, predator avoidance and migration) that require sustained power output during submergence. Since most voluntary dives are believed to remain aerobic, the goal of this study was to examine the potential importance of the dive response in optimizing the use of blood and muscle oxygen stores during dives involving different levels of muscular exertion. To accomplish this, we designed a numerical model based on Fick's principle that integrated cardiac output (Vb), regional blood flow, convective oxygen transport (Q(O2)), muscle oxymyoglobin desaturation and regional rates of oxygen consumption (VO2). The model quantified how the optimal matching or mismatching of QO2 to VO2 affected the aerobic dive limit (ADL). We chose an adult Weddell seal Leptonycotes weddellii on which to base our model because of available data on the diving physiology and metabolism of this species. The results show that the use of blood and muscle oxygen stores must be completed at the same time to maximize the ADL for each level of VO2. This is achieved by adjusting Vb (range 19-94 % of resting levels) and muscle QO2 according to the rate of muscle oxygen consumption (VMO2). At higher values of VMO2, Vb and muscle perfusion must increase to maintain an appropriate QO2/VO2 ratio so that available blood and muscle oxygen stores are depleted at the same time. Although the dive response does not sequester blood oxygen exclusively for brain and heart metabolism during aerobic dives, as it does during forced submersion, a reduction in Vb and muscle perfusion below resting levels is necessary to maximize the ADL over the range of diving VO2 (approximately 2-9 ml O2 min-1 kg-1). Despite the reduction in Vb, convective oxygen transport is adequate to maintain aerobic metabolism and normal function in the splanchnic organs, kidneys and other peripheral tissues. As a result, physiological homeostasis is maintained throughout the dive. The model shows that the cardiovascular adjustments known as the dive response enable the diving seal to balance the conflicting metabolic demands of (1) optimizing the distribution and use of blood and muscle oxygen stores to maximize the ADL over the normal range of diving VO2 and (2) ensuring that active muscle receives adequate oxygen as VMO2 increases.

N2  - Last ten years have seen a explosion in the number distance learning programs offered by educational institutions . Distance learning programs of various types are available through more than 1,000 educational institutions in the United States. [1] Estimates are that by the year 2007 almost 50 percent of all learners enrolled in postsecondary education courses will take some of their courses through distance education formats. [2] Offering distance learning programs in Engineering and Engineering Technology pose special challenges for institutions. While it is relatively easy to modify a lecture course for distance education, it is the laboratory courses that offer real challenge. Various solutions have been proposed to address the problem of offering realistic laboratories experience for distance learners. These include virtual Laboratories, computer based simulations, videotaped laboratory experiments and mobile laboratories. This paper discusses the effort that has gone into the design and construction of a mobile laboratory to be used in conjunction with the televised program in Mechanical Engineering Technology Program at Old Dominion University.

N2  - During diving, marine mammals must balance the conservation of limited oxygen reserves with the metabolic costs of swimming exercise. As a result, energetically efficient modes of locomotion provide an advantage during periods of submergence and will presumably increase in importance as the animals perform progressively longer dives. To determine the effect of a limited oxygen supply on locomotor performance, we compared the kinematics and behavior of swimming and diving bottlenose dolphins. Adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were trained to swim horizontally near the water surface or submerged at 5 m and to dive to depths ranging from 12 to 112 m. Swimming kinematics (preferred swimming mode, stroke frequency and duration of glides) were monitored using submersible video cameras (Sony Hi-8) held by SCUBA divers or attached to a pack on the dorsal fin of the animal. Drag and buoyant forces were calculated from patterns of deceleration for horizontally swimming and vertically diving animals. The results showed that dolphins used a variety of swimming gaits that correlated with acceleration. The percentage of time spent gliding during the descent phase of dives increased with depth. Glide distances ranged from 7.1+/-1.9 m for 16 m dives to 43.6+/-7.0 m (means +/- s.e.m.) for 100 m dives. These gliding patterns were attributed to changes in buoyancy associated with lung compression at depth. By incorporating prolonged glide periods, the bottlenose dolphin realized a theoretical 10-21 % energetic savings in the cost of a 100 m dive in comparison with dives based on neutral buoyancy models. Thus, modifying locomotor patterns to account for physical changes with depth appears to be one mechanism that enables diving mammals with limited oxygen stores to extend the duration of a dive.

N2  - Locomotor activity by diving marine mammals is accomplished while breath-holding and often exceeds predicted aerobic capacities. Video sequences of freely diving seals and whales wearing submersible cameras reveal a behavioral strategy that improves energetic efficiency in these animals. Prolonged gliding (greater than 78% descent duration) occurred during dives exceeding 80 meters in depth. Gliding was attributed to buoyancy changes with lung compression at depth. By modifying locomotor patterns to take advantage of these physical changes, Weddell seals realized a 9.2 to 59.6% reduction in diving energetic costs. This energy-conserving strategy allows marine mammals to increase aerobic dive duration and achieve remarkable depths despite limited oxygen availability when submerged.

N2  - Amino sugars were determined in natural samples, including seawater, using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and a new-off-line sample cleanup procedure. Samples were hydrolyzed with 3 M HCl for 5 h (100 degrees C) and neutralized with anion retardation resin. Before injection, salts and organic contaminants were removed with a strong cation exchanger in the Na+ form. Detection limits for amino sugars were between 1 and 4 nM (signal-to-noise ratio 3), allowing for the first time quantification of amino sugars in seawater without preconcentration. Precision was 2-11% at the 20 nM level. The relatively simple and rapid sample preparation makes it suitable for routine analyses.

N2  - A sensitive method involving solid-phase extraction and HPLC analysis of methylene blue has been developed to measure nanomolar levels of dissolved sulfide in oxic surface waters. The procedure included 1) a preconcentration step, in which methylene blue generated from sulfide reaction with n,n-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine in acidic conditions in the presence of ferric ion was absorbed onto Waters tC18 cartridge; and 2) a determination step, in which methylene blue was separated by HPLC in a gradient elution to minimize natural organic matter interference and detected by absorbance. The concentrations of the dissolved sulfide, quantified by standard addition, were about 2.1-4.7 nM in oxic surface waters from Galveston Bay, Texas.

N2  - Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was tested for the isolation of dissolved lignin from diverse natural waters (fresh, estuarine, and marine) in preparation for CuO oxidation. Capillary GC coupled to selected-ion monitoring mass spectrometry (SIM-MS) of CuO oxidation products provides the high sensitivity and precision required for the identification and quantification of trace levels of lignin in seawater. The low blanks and quick cleanup of C18 cartridges support SPE for processing such samples. Comparison of SPE with other isolation procedures (direct dry-down and ultrafiltration) has shown that this method quantitatively recovers dissolved lignin and preserves its compositional parameters. The concentration and nature of dissolved organic matter appear to be primary factors that constrain the amount of water that should be processed to obtain quantitative and reproducible recoveries of dissolved lignin using SPE. Highest recoveries of dissolved lignin were obtained at low pH (1.5-4.0) with substantial decreases at pH > 4. Extraction efficiencies were independent of flow rate within a range of five to fifteen bed volumes per minute (50-150 mL min(-1)), and both refrigeration and freezing were appropriate long-term storage methods for processed cartridges prior to elution of retained dissolved lignin.

N2  - An expert system based on VIMS (Virginia Institute of Marine Science) TPWQM (tidal prism water quality model) was developed for VPDES (Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System). The goal was to provide an easy-to-use tool for water quality management of small coastal basins and tidal creeks in Virginia. The expert system consists of two stand-alone, but sequentially connected, programs. 'Preprocessor for Geometry' takes user input of geometric and tidal information of a coastal basin and performs automatic model segmentation based on tidal prism. 'Preprocessor for TPWQM' calculates dissolved oxygen based on proposed point source discharge of organic carbon and nutrients. Input parameters, evaluated from the analysis of extensive data sets and previous model applications for small coastal basins in Virginia, were embedded into the TPWQM. The present version of the expert system was written for personal computers using the Windows 95/98 operating system.

N2  - A comprehensive study to evaluate the fate and environmental effects of two shoreline cleaners was conducted in the mesocosm beaches at the Shoreline Environmental Research Facility, in Corpus Christi, TX. Experimental treatments included oil only control, oil plus Corexit 9550®, and oil plus CytoSol®. Both in-situ and ex-situ bioassays were performed to evaluate the biological effects to the immediate treatment areas and the adjacent water columns. In-situ test organisms included fiddler crabs (Uca sp.) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica), which were exposed to the immediate treatment areas and the sub-tidal water columns respectively. Sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) were exposed to tank effluent samples according to EPA guidelines. Insufficient TPH concentrations caused acute harm to both the oysters and minnows. The fiddler crab, amphipod, and sediment elutriate assays indicated that the initial oil application was responsible for significant ecological harm. Enhanced recovery due to the shoreline cleaners was suggested by the sediment elutriate test. However, the amphipod test indicated toxicity remained unchanged overtime with the shoreline cleaner applications. Sediment dwelling organisms were at greater risk to oil spills and chemical response agents than their water column dwelling counter parts. This was due both to the higher contaminant concentration and longer contaminant residence times in the beach substrates. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 23rd Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program, AMOP Technical Seminar (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 6/14-16/2000).

N2  - An experiment was conducted at a wave-tank facility, investigating shoreline-cleaner use on oiled sandy substrates. In each tank, a beach was configured, wave/tidal cycles were used, and alongshore currents were simulated through the use of influent/effiuent flow ports. The experimental treatments included oiled control, oil-plus-Corexit® 9580, and oil-plus-CytoSol®. Oil was applied to each beach and weathered 24 hr before experimental onset. Some comparisons between treatments were difficult. In the oiled-control tank, 75% of the oil could not be accounted for in the materials balance; this was partially due to beach erosion. The CytoSol tank also experienced beach erosion to a similar degree, but most of the oil was accounted for in the materials balance. The CytoSol shoreline cleaner was more effective than the Corexit 9580 cleaner. CytoSol mobilized and removed a higher percentage of the oil from the sandy substrate, with the aid of the high-energy waves. The CytoSol-treated slick was more manageable and easier to collect at the end of the experiment. The CytoSol-treated oil was subject to entrainment in the water column, as evidenced by the higher oil losses in the effluent. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 23rd Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program, AMOP Technical Seminar (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 6/14-16/2000).

N2  - A procedure using SPE for the quantitative determination of oil films and slicks floating on water surfaces was developed. During phase one of the study, nine oil loadings (Exxon #6 fuel oil: 3-38 mg/sq cm) were sub sampled with C18-SPE disks in replicates from the surface of 1 L beakers. A modified SPE method using C-18 SPE disks allowed for quantitative recoveries of oil from surface slicks/films. The sampling efficiency was strongly linear over the whole range tested, the variability was < 10%, and the oil was collected by the SPE disks in a 1:1 ratio relative to the water surface loadings. The application of this method to a meso-scale salt-water wave tank showed a strong potential for this technique to be used for the quantification and fingerprinting of oil present in meso-scale to large-scale slicks/films in experimental or natural settings. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 23rd Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program, AMOP Technical Seminar (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 6/14-16/2000).

N2  - A method based on a new type of low impact skimmer, an inovacor SurfCleaner®, was developed to quantify the mass of oil contained in mesocosm surface slicks. The ability to measure the oil mass of all components led to an average recovery of 98% of spilled oil mixtures in controlled mesoscale pools. The introduction of oil into the water column was minimized and the thickness of the sampled surface layer optimized by adjusting the throughput of the skimmer. To maximize the accuracy of the technique, the recovered mixtures are decanted, and the percentage of water of the resulting oil-water emulsions are factored in the measurement of the recovered oil masses. The technique showed great accuracy and reliability, small improvements could further enhance its accuracy, and possibly made its application even more straightforward. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 23rd Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program, AMOP Technical Seminar (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 6/14-16/2000).

N2  - Twelve spotted seals (Phoca largha) equipped with satellite-linked tags were tracked in the Bering Sea for 46-272 days during August-June 1991-1994. Alaskan seals were mostly near shore during August-October and 100-200 km offshore in January-June, and were broadly distributed in the region north of the 200-m isobath. Russian seals were located primarily near shore and within 100 km of the 200-m isobath during all months. During August-October, all seals were usually more than 200 km south of the sea-ice edge. In January-June, seals were mostly 0-200 km north of the sea-ice edge, often in areas with extensive ice coverage (7/10-9/10). We tested for habitat selection by determining how frequently a randomly moving seal would have been located in each habitat and comparing that with observed habitat use. Russian seals selected for nearshore and shallow-water areas in September-October and for near shore, within 25 km of the 200-m isobath, and the ice front during November-April. Alaskan seals selected for near shore areas in September-December; for offshore, shallow water, and the ice front in January-February; and for shallow water and pack ice in March-April. Biological processes associated with the highly productive 'Green Belt' may have influenced the habitat use of Russian seals, but this did not appear to have been the case with Alaskan seals.

N2  - Myoglobin is an important storage site for oxygen in the swimming muscles of diving marine mammals. However, little is known about its distribution within muscles since previous studies have relied on single samples. The goal of this study was to determine the distribution of myoglobin within the swimming muscles of five species of cetacean: dusky dolphin, false killer whale, striped dolphin, humpbacked dolphin and bottlenose dolphin. The entire dorsal (epaxial) and ventral (hypaxial) swimming muscles were removed from each animal and weighed. Transverse sections were taken from the cranial, middle and caudal regions of each muscle and sampled along a circular grid with a minimum of 30 sites per section. Spectrophotometric analysis was used to measure the myoglobin concentration of each sample. Contour maps of myoglobin concentration were made for each transverse section. Myoglobin concentration was found to be non-uniformly distributed within the muscle. The interior of the muscle lying closest to the vertebrae showed a significantly higher (11 %) mean myoglobin concentration than the exterior of the muscle for all five species. In the epaxial muscles, the mean myoglobin concentration was significantly higher in the caudal region closest to the flukes. The two deep-water species (false killer whale and striped dolphin) had significantly higher myoglobin concentrations than the three species (dusky, humpbacked and bottlenose dolphins) that occur in shallow, coastal waters. These results show that myoglobin is not homogeneously distributed in the locomotory muscle of cetaceans and that levels may be highest in those areas that produce greater force and consume more oxygen during aerobic swimming. Enhancing oxygen stores in those areas of the muscle that work the hardest would theoretically lengthen the aerobic dive limit of the animal during submerged swimming.

N2  - To examine the effects of dissolved organic matter on metal bioavailability, uptake of trace metals (Cd, Co, Hg, Cr, Ag, Zn) by American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) was compared between treatments with different dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and contrasting low molecular weight (LMW, 1 kDa) and high molecular weight (HMW, 1 kDa-0.2 micron) DOC fractions, using radiotracer techniques and short-term exposure experiments. Uptake rate constants (mL g-1 h-1) of metals, in general, increased with increasing DOC concentrations, with an initial decrease at lower DOC concentrations. Oyster dry weight concentration factors (DCF, mL g-1), determined at the end of exposure experiments (8 h), also increased for Cd, Co, Cr, Ag, and Zn, but decreased for Hg, with increasing DOC concentrations. Changes of metal uptake rate constants and DCF values with DOC concentration suggest that metal uptake pathways by American oysters vary from predominantly uptake (by diffusion of neutral) of free ionic, inorganically complexed, and LMW organic ligand complexed metals at very low DOC concentration to direct ingestion and digestion of HMW or colloidally complexed metals at higher DOC concentrations. Measured partition coefficients (Kc) between dissolved and colloidal phases were comparable between metals, ranging from 10(5.12) to 10(5.75) mL g-1. However, DCF values and uptake rate constants differed considerably between metals, with the highest DCF values and uptake rate constants found for B-type metals, e.g., Ag, Hg, Zn, and Cd, and the lowest ones for several intermediate-type metals (e.g., Co, Cr). Metal types and thus the interaction of metals with organic ligands, such as strong complexation of B-type metals with S-containing organic ligands, may play an important role in the bioavailability and toxicity of metals to aquatic organisms. Differences in metal uptake in contrasting LMW and HMW DOC treatments suggest a generally depressed bioavailability of colloidally complexed metals at low DOC concentration (0.5 ppm) but a generally enhanced uptake at higher DOC concentrations.

N2  - Variations in porosity of surface sediments are often the major cause of sediment loss during gravity and box coring. Sediments with a high content of organic matter usually have higher porosity, and thus, lower resistance (strain) towards mechanical disturbance. Here, we demonstrate that box coring artifacts (i.e. sediment loss and core shortening) can be produced in sediments from the Palos Verdes (PV) shelf, which in the past had received relatively high loads of organic carbon (OC) enriched particulate matter originating from the Whites Point outfall that had created a high porosity layer at depth. This has been overlooked as a possibility for obtaining low estimates of sediment and pollutant accumulation rates. Since any such sediment loss during coring can lead to serious underestimates of sedimentation rates, our results here may have important implications for any attempts at reconstructing pollutant fluxes and histories in these coastal marine sediments.

N2  - Aquatic colloids, including macromolecules and microparticles, with sizes ranging between 1 nm to 1 micron, play important roles in the mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals and other contaminants in natural waters. Cross-flow ultrafiltration has become one of the most commonly used techniques for isolating aquatic colloids. However, the ultrafiltration behavior of chemical species remains poorly understood. We report here the permeation behavior of major ions (Na, Ca, Mg, F, Cl, and SO4) in natural waters during ultrafiltration using an Amicon 1 kDa ultrafiltration membrane (S10N1). Water samples across a salinity gradient of 0-20@1000 were collected from the Trinity River and Galveston Bay. The permeation behavior of major ions was well predicted by a permeation model, resulting in a constant permeation coefficient for each ion. The value of the model-derived permeation coefficient (Pc) was 0.99 for Na, 0.97 for Cl, and 0.95 for F, respectively, in Trinity River waters. Values of Pc close to 1 indicate that retention of Na, Cl, and F by the 1 kDa membrane during ultrafiltration was indeed minimal (< 1-5%). In contrast, significant (14-36%) retention was observed for SO4, Ca, and Mg in Trinity River waters, with a Pc value of 0.64, 0.82, and 0.86 for SO4, Ca and Mg, respectively. However, these retained major ions can further permeate through the 1 kDa membrane during diafiltration with ultrapure water. The selective retention of major ions during ultrafiltration may have important implications for the measurement of chemical and physical speciation of trace elements when using cross-flow ultrafiltration membranes to separate colloidal species from natural waters. Our results also demonstrate that the percent retention of major ions during ultrafiltration decreases with increasing salinity or ionic strength. This retention is largely attributed to electrostatic repulsion by the negatively charged cartridge membrane.

N2  - Most of the oceanic reservoir of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of marine origin and is resistant to microbial oxidation, but little is known about the mechanisms of its formation. In a laboratory study, natural assemblages of marine bacteria rapidly (in <48 hours) utilized labile compounds (glucose, glutamate) and produced refractory DOM that persisted for more than a year. Only 10 to 15% of the bacterially derived DOM was identified as hydrolyzable amino acids and sugars, a feature consistent with marine DOM. These results suggest that microbial processes alter the molecular structure of DOM, making it resistant to further degradation and thereby preserving fixed carbon in the ocean.

N2  - <jats:p>Cave diving is one of the most technical and potential dangerous forms of diving done today. It may involve use of multiple tanks, regulators and gas mixtures or rebreathers, in combination with powerful long-range diver propulsion vehicles, to penetrate thousands of meters into submerged
 cave systems where direct ascent to the surface in the case of emergencies is impossible. In order to carry out scientific studies under such difficult conditions, individuals must be highly competent and experienced cave divers. In spite of these problems, numerous scientific investigations
 in the fields of biology, ecology, microbiology, geology, hydrology and archaeology have carried out by cave diving scientists. Exploratory cave divers have provided the initial impetus for this research by exploring and mapping underwater caves.</jats:p>

N2  - Among terrestrial mammals, the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract reflects the metabolic demands of the animal and individual requirements for processing, distributing, and absorbing nutrients. To determine if gastrointestinal tract morphology is similarly correlated with metabolic requirements in marine mammals, we examined the relationship between basal metabolic rate (BMR) and small intestinal length in pinnipeds and cetaceans. Oxygen consumption was measured for resting bottlenose dolphins and Weddell seals, and the results combined with data for four additional species of carnivorous marine mammal. Data for small intestinal length were obtained from previously published reports. Similar analyses were conducted for five species of carnivorous terrestrial mammal, for which BMR and intestinal length were known. The results indicate that the BMRs of Weddell seals and dolphins resting on the water surface are 1.6 and 2.3 times the predicted levels for similarly sized domestic terrestrial mammals, respectively. Small intestinal lengths for carnivorous marine mammals depend on body size and are comparatively longer than those of terrestrial carnivores. The relationship between basal metabolic rate (kcal day(-1)) and small intestinal length (m) for both marine and terrestrial carnivores was, BMR=142.5 intestinal length(1.20) (r(2)=0.83). We suggest that elevated metabolic rates among marine mammal carnivores are associated with comparatively large alimentary tracts that are presumably required for supporting the energetic demands of an aquatic lifestyle and for feeding on vertebrate and invertebrate prey.

N2  - Profiles of trace contaminant concentrations in sediment columns can be a natural archive from which pollutant inputs into coastal areas can be reconstructed. Reconstruction of historical inputs of anthropogenic chemicals is important for improving management strategies and evaluating the success of recent pollution controls measures. Here we report a reconstruction of historical contamination into three coastal sites along the US Gulf Coast: Mississippi River Delta, Galveston Bay and Tampa Bay. Within the watersheds of these areas are extensive agricultural lands as well as more than 50% of the chemical and refinery capacity of the USA. Despite this pollution potential, relatively low concentrations of trace metals and trace organic contaminants were found in one core from each of the three sites. Concentrations and fluxes of most trace metals found in surface sediments at these three sites, when normalized to Al, are typical for uncontaminated Gulf Coast sediments. Hydrophobic trace organic contaminants that are anthropogenic (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, DDTs, and polychlorinated biphenyls) are found in sediments from all locations. The presence in surface sediments from the Mississippi River Delta of low level trace contaminants such as DDTs, which were banned in the early 1970's, indicate that they are still washed out from cultivated soils. It appears that the DDTs profile in that sediment core was produced by a combination of erosion processes of riverine and other sedimentary deposits during floods. Most of the pollutant profiles indicate that present-day conditions have improved from the more contaminated conditions in the 1950-1970's, before the advent of the Clean Water Act.

N2  - We attached a video system and data recorder to a northern elephant seal to track its three-dimensional movements and observe propulsive strokes of the hind flippers. During 6 h of recording, the seal made 20 dives and spent 90% of the time submerged. Average dive duration, maximum depth and swimming speed were 14.9 min+/-6.1 S.D., 289 m+/-117 S.D. and 1.1 m s(-1)+/-0.12 S.D., respectively. The distance swum during a dive averaged 925 m+/-339 S.D., and the average descent and ascent angles were 41 degrees +/-18 S.D. and 50 degrees +/-21 S.D., respectively. Dive paths were remarkably straight suggesting that the seal was navigating while submerged. We identified three modes of swimming based on the interval between propulsive strokes: continuous stroking; stroke-and-glide swimming; and prolonged gliding. The seal used continuous stroking from the surface to a mean depth of 20 m followed by stroke-and-glide swimming. Prolonged gliding started at a mean depth of 60 m and continued to the bottom of dives. For dives to depths of 300 m or more, 75% of the descent time was spent in prolonged gliding and 10% in stroke-and-glide swimming, amounting to 5.9-9.6 min of passive descent per dive. Average swimming speed varied little with swimming mode and was not a good indicator of propulsive effort. It appears that the seal can use prolonged gliding to reduce the cost of transport and increase dive duration. Energetically efficient locomotion may help explain the long and deep dives that routinely exceed the theoretical aerobic dive limit in this species.

N2  - In the past, the excretory systems of only few vestimentiferan species have been examined in detail. This study presents comparative data on eight species on the basis of histological serial sections. Ridgeia piscesae was studied by transmission electron microscopy. All species examined possess a central excretory organ consisting of numerous small branching and intertwined excretory tubules. These are connected to voluminous glandular excretory ducts that lead to the exterior by single or paired excretory pores located at the anterior end of the vestimentum. A comparative analysis shows differences among the species with regard to several features, such as the number of excretory pores, presence/absence of excretory grooves and papillae, position of the excretory organ relative to the brain, and the shape of the excretory ducts. Neither podocytes nor coelomoducts could be detected; therefore, there is no indication of the presence of metanephridia. The vestimentiferan excretory system shows some similarities with the design in Athecanephria (Pogonophora, Perviata) and a general resemblance to the design in sabellid polychaetes, even though in the latter metanephridia are clearly present.

N2  - The watershed processes which control 129I/127I ratios, 129I and 127I concentrations, and speciation of iodine isotopes were studied through an investigation into the variability of these parameters in the Mississippi River near New Orleans, undertaken in 1996-1998. Analyses of suspended particulate matter (SPM) revealed a greater percent association of 127I than of 129I, resulting in lower 129I/127I ratios in SPM than in surrounding water. Furthermore, crossflow ultrafiltration showed that organo-iodine was the dominant form for both isotopes, with 70-85% of these isotopes found in the 0.45 microm filter-passing fraction associated with colloidal macromolecular organic matter. 129I showed a weak correlation, 127I no correlation, and 129I/127I ratios a strong inverse correlation with river flow rate. Inverse correlations between 129I/127I ratios and river flow rates can be best explained by rainwater and evapotranspiration dominated ratios at base flow and a lowering of the isotope ratios during higher flow due to extra inputs of 127I from soil weathering. We postulate that different equilibration times for 127I and 129I as well as for bomb-produced 129I and reprocessing-produced 129I are responsible for these fractionation effects and the differential mobilities of these isotopes in the Mississippi River watershed.

N2  - Amidst uncertainties caused by the complex history of sediment transport in coastal areas, radionuclide geochronology allowed a consistent historical reconstruction of the historical evolution of trace contaminant inputs into the Mississippi River Delta, Galveston Bay, and Tampa Bay. The areas received contaminants from a drainage basin, which contains > 50% of the chemical and refinery capacity of the US. Low concentrations of trace metals and trace organic contaminants were encountered at these sites. Fluxes and concentrations of most contaminants were within the range reported for relatively uncontaminated Gulf of Mexico sediments. The pollutant profiles indicate that present-day situation is continuing to improve from the more contaminated conditions in the 1950-1970s. Management strategies to ban the use of organochlorine contaminants have resulted in declining concentrations. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 221st ACS National Meeting (San Diego, CA 4/1-5/2001).

N2  - Among non-mammalian vertebrates, rigid skulls with tight sutural junctions are associated with high levels of cranial loading. The rigid skulls of mammals presumably act to resist the stresses of mastication. The pig, Sus scrofa, is a generalized ungulate with a diet rich in resistant foods. This report synthesizes previous work using strain gages bonded to the bones and sutures of the braincase, zygomatic arch, jaw joint, and mandible with new studies on the maxilla. Strains were recorded during unrestrained mastication and/or in anesthetized pigs during muscle stimulation. Bone strains were 100-1000 micro epsilon, except in the braincase, but sutural strains were higher, regardless of region. Strain regimes were specific to different regions, indicating that theoretical treatment of the skull as a unitary structure is probably incorrect. Muscle contraction, especially the masseter, caused strain patterns by four mechanisms: (1) direct loading of muscle attachment areas; (2) a compressive reaction force at the jaw joint; (3) bite force loading on the snout and mandible; and (4) movement causing new points of contact between mandible and cranium. Some expected patterns of loading were not seen. Most notably, strains did not differ for right and left chewing, perhaps because pigs have bilateral occlusion and masseter activity.

N2  - Sirenians, including Florida manatees, possess an array of hairs and bristles on the face. These are distributed in a pattern involving nine distinct regions of the face, unlike that of any other mammalian order. Some of these bristles and hairs are known to be used in tactile exploration and in grasping behaviors. In the present study we characterized the microanatomical structure of the hair and bristle follicles from the nine regions of the face. All follicles had the attributes of vibrissae, including a dense connective tissue capsule, prominent blood sinus complex, and substantial innervation. Each of the nine regions of the face exhibited a distinct combination of these morphological attributes, congruent with the previous designation of these regions based on location and external morphological criteria. The present data suggest that perioral bristles in manatees might have a tactile sensory role much like that of vibrissae in other mammals, in addition to their documented role in grasping of plants during feeding. Such a combination of motor and sensory usages would be unique to sirenians. Finally, we speculate that the facial hairs and bristles may play a role in hydrodynamic reception.

N2  - Kinetics and the extent of metal partitioning between colloidal and dissolved phases and coagulation of metals associated with colloids were examined to determine their effects on the bioavailability of selected metals (Cd, Co, Hg, Ag, Fe, and Zn) to American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) using radiotracer and short term exposure experiments. After dispersion of radiolabeled colloids into low molecular weight (LMW, < 1 kDa) seawater, metal partitioning between dissolved (<1 kDa) and colloidal (1 kDa-0.2 microm) phases resulted in a consistent pattern, with a relatively constant percentage in the colloidal phase for each metal. On average, about 90% of Hg and Fe, approximately 60% of Ag and approximately 40% of Zn, Co, and Cd were measured in the colloidal fraction during a short term exposure experiment, consistent with their partitioning in natural waters. Controlled laboratory experiments carried out in parallel using radioactively tagged colloids showed that coagulation of colloidal species, quantified as the fraction retained by a 0.2 microm filter, was insignificant for most metals under the conditions and time periods of the uptake experiments. The bioavailability of colloidally complexed metals, measured in terms of dry weight concentration factor (DCF, ml g(-1)) and uptake rate constant (ml g(-1) h(-1)), was somewhat depressed compared with their counterpart in the LMW treatment, but could be well predicted from the results of the LMW treatment and metal partitioning. Both DCF values and uptake rate constants were higher in the LMW treatment than in the colloidal treatment. In addition, B-type metals, such as Ag, Hg, and Zn, all had higher values of DCF and uptake rate constants, regardless of treatments, except for Cd which had a lower DCF and uptake rate constant. In contrast, Co and Fe had significantly lower DCF values and uptake rate constants. Most of Hg and Ag (60-80%) were measured in the soft tissue of oysters in both LMW and colloidal treatments. In contrast, 80% of Fe, 75% of Co, and approximately 60% of Cd were observed on the shell, while Zn was found evenly distributed between shell and soft tissue of oysters. These results agree well with the variation pattern of both DCF value and uptake rate constant for these two groups of metals.

N2  - Previous reports have suggested that the sparsely distributed hairs found on the entire postcranial body of sirenians are all sinus type tactile hairs. This would represent a unique arrangement because no other mammal has been reported to possess tactile hairs except on restricted regions of the body, primarily the face. In order to investigate this issue further, hair counts were made systematically in three Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris), and hair follicle microanatomy was studied in 110 specimens gathered from 9 animals. We found that the postcranial body possesses approximately 1500 hairs per side, and hair density decreases from dorsal to ventral. External hair length ranged from 2-9 mm, and most hairs were separated from their nearest neighbor by 20-40 mm, resulting in an independent domain of movement for each hair. All hairs exhibited the anatomical characteristics of follicle-sinus complexes typical of tactile hairs, including a dense connective tissue capsule containing an elongated circumferential blood sinus and innervation by 20-50 axons which ascend the mesenchymal sheath. We conclude that this represents a unique distributed underwater tactile system capable of conveying detailed and significant external information concerning approaching animals, water currents and possibly the presence of large stationary features of the environment. Such a system would be analogous to the lateral line in fish, and would be particularly useful in the turbid habitat frequented by Florida manatees.

N2  - Elevated levels of (239,240)Pu and 241Am have been present in surficial soils of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), CO, since the 1960s, when soils were locally contaminated in the 1960s by leaking drums stored on the 903 Pad. Further dispersion of contaminated soil particles was by wind and water. From 1998 until 2001, we examined actinide ((239,240)Pu and 241Am) concentrations and phase speciation in the surface environment at RFETS through field studies and laboratory experiments. Measurements of total (239,240)Pu and 241Am concentrations in storm runoff and pond discharge samples, collected during spring and summer times in 1998-2000, demonstrate that most of the (239,240)Pu and 241Am transported from contaminated soils to streams occurred in the particulate (> or = 0.45 microm; 40-90%) and colloidal (approximately 2 nm or 3 kDa to 0.45 microm; 10-60%) phases. Controlled laboratory investigations of soil resuspension, which simulated storm and erosion events, confirmed that most of the Pu in the 0.45 microm filter-passing phase was in the colloidal phase (> or = 80%) and that remobilization of colloid-bound Pu during soil erosion events can be greatly enhanced by humic and fulvic acids present in these soils. Most importantly, isoelectric focusing experiments of radiolabeled colloidal matter extracted from RFETS soils revealed that colloidal Pu is in the four-valent state and is mostly associated with a negatively charged organic macromolecule with a pH(IEP) of 3.1 and a molecular weight of 10-15 kDa, rather than with the more abundant inorganic (iron oxide and clay) colloids. This finding has important ramifications for possible remediation, erosion controls, and land-management strategies.

Samples were collected and analyzed for total (unfiltered collections), filtered (0.1 and 0.4 microm), particulate (> or = 0.45 microm), and colloidal Ag (3 kDa-0.1 m) using ultraclean protocols. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to assess bias from sample storage, digestion, and preconcentration protocols. In general, upstream unfiltered and particulate Ag concentrations fell within a fairly narrow range, 3.1 to 21 ng/L and 0.2 to 1.7 microg/g, respectively. Downstream unfiltered and particulate Ag concentrations showed a more broad range, 2.8 to 1,110 ng/L and 0.5 to 104 microg/g, respectively, and reflected attenuated impacts of Ag-laden discharge effluents. However, Ag concentrations in the 0.1-microm filter-passing fraction 0.8 to 1.2 km downstream from major treatment plant effluents were all below the chronic silver criteria. On average, more than 60% of the 0.1-microm filter-passing Ag was associated with colloidal macromolecular organic matter. Silver concentrations in colloids (microg/g) were, on average, the same as those in suspended particulate matter. The percentage abundance of colloidal Ag was similar to that of dissolved organic carbon, suggesting that strong Ag binding ligands exist in both the colloidal and the particle size fractions, as these macromolecular ligands likely play a major role in Ag speciation.

N2  - In contrast to terrestrial animals that function under hypoxic conditions but display the typical exercise response of increasing ventilation and cardiac output, marine mammals exercise under a different form of hypoxic stress. They function for the duration of a dive under progressive asphyxia, which is the combination of increasing hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis. Our previous studies on short-duration, shallow divers found marked adaptations in their skeletal muscles, which culminated in enhanced aerobic capacities that are similar to those of athletic terrestrial mammals. The purpose of the present study was to assess the aerobic capacity of skeletal muscles from long-duration divers. Swimming and non-swimming muscles were collected from adult Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddelli, and processed for morphometric analysis, enzymology, myoglobin concentrations and fiber-type distribution. The results showed that the skeletal muscles of Weddell seals do not have enhanced aerobic capacities compared with those of terrestrial mammals but are adapted to maintain low levels of an aerobic lipid-based metabolism, especially under the hypoxic conditions associated with diving. The lower aerobic capacity of Weddell seal muscle as compared with that of shorter-duration divers appears to reflect their energy-conserving modes of locomotion, which enable longer and deeper dives.

N2  - There has been considerable debate about whether the Atlantic northern bluefin tuna exist as a single panmictic unit. We have addressed this issue by examining both mitochondrial DNA control region nucleotide sequences and nuclear gene ldhA allele frequencies in replicate size or year class samples of northern bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean Sea and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Pairwise comparisons of multiple year class samples from the 2 regions provided no evidence for population subdivision. Similarly, analyses of molecular variance of both mitochondrial and ldhA data revealed no significant differences among or between samples from the 2 regions. These results demonstrate the importance of analyzing multiple year classes and large sample sizes to obtain accurate estimates when using allele frequencies to characterize a population. It is important to note that the absence of genetic evidence for population substructure does not unilaterally constitute evidence of a single panmictic population, as genetic differentiation can be prevented by large population sizes and by migration.

N2  - We analyzed 1317-1823 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA sequence beginning in the 5' end of cytochrome b (cyt b) and ending in the central domain of the control region for 25 American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) and compared these to a homologous sequence from a Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). Both species share a non-coding spacer between cyt b and tRNA(Thr). Chinese alligator cyt b differs from that of the American alligator by 17.5% at the nucleotide level and 13.8% for inferred amino acids, which is consistent with their presumed ancient divergence. Only two cyt b haplotypes were detected among the 25 American alligators (693-1199 bp surveyed), with one haplotype shared among 24 individuals. One alligator from Mississippi differed from all other alligators by a single silent substitution. The control region contained only slightly more variation among the 25 American alligators, with two variable positions (624 bp surveyed), yielding three haplotypes with 22, two, and one individuals in each of these groups. Previous genetic studies examining allozymes and the proportion of variable microsatellite DNA loci also found low levels of genetic diversity in American alligators. However, in contrast with allozymes, microsatellites, and morphology, the mtDNA data shows no evidence of differentiation among populations from the extremes of the species range. These results suggest that American alligators underwent a severe population bottleneck in the late Pleistocene, resulting in nearly homogenous mtDNA among all American alligators today.

N2  - Activities of radionuclides in the 238U (230Th, 226Ra, 210Pb) and 232Th (232Th, 228Th, 228Ra) decay series were determined in sediments from an east Texas watershed and examined with isotope ratios and compared to particulate organic carbon (POC), % fines (<63 microm) and total concentrations of Al, Fe and Mn. The objective was to elucidate the presence or absence of relationships affecting the effectiveness of these radionuclides in modeling sediment transport. Strong positive correlations were observed between radionuclides and Mn (Th) and % fines (Ra and Th). Isotope ratios effectively reduce these influences, supporting the contention that isotope ratios offset extrinsic variability in terrestrial sediments. Strong associations of 210Pbxs (excess 210Pb) and 226Ra/230Th with POC agree with data from marine and terrestrial settings, indicating that the role of POC in isotope fractionation, transport and sequestration merits further investigation.

N2  - <jats:p>Surface finish in end milling depends upon a number of variables, such as feed rate, cutting speed, tool material, etc. The relative effect of these variables on surface roughness is not understood very well. The Taguchi method is used in end milling process to identify variables having major influence on surface finish. Partial factorial design using L9 orthogonal array is used in the design of experiments. Signal to Noise ratio analysis along with analysis of variance is used to study the effect of these parameters on surface finish. Knowledge about these relationships will help a process planner or a machinist optimize the cutting process with respect to surface finish.</jats:p>

Speleonectes tanumekes is a comparatively long and slender species distinguished by the largest number of trunk segments found in remipedes to date. Speleonectes parabenjamini is morphologically closely related to Speleonectes benjamini, but differs from the latter species by several distinct autapomorphies. Speleonectes minnsi is characterized by comparatively robust maxillules. The occurrence of three sympatric species is a remarkable record for the Remipedia adding to a total of 10 sympatric taxa. We discuss the high diversity of remipedes in the larger West Indian region with regard to their evolutionary history and origin.</jats:p>

N2  - Ratios of particulate organic carbon (POC) to particulate 234Th activities (POC/234Th) in the ocean are used to determine the POC export flux, and thus, the power of the biological pump. In order to understand the main reasons why this ratio frequently varies as a function of depth, size, and kind (suspended vs. sinking particles), we measured vertical profiles in a cold core ring and warm core ring in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2001. Here we show that particulate 234Th/POC ratios in the Gulf of Mexico are positively correlated to the content of different Th(IV)-binding polysaccharide fractions (uronic acids, total acid poly accharides, total polysaccharides) in both suspended and sinking particles as well as to prymnesiophyte abundance, but negatively correlated to bacterial production. Variations in acid polysaccharide compounds, produced by both algae and bacteria, but degraded only by bacteria, can account for observed variations in POC/234Th ratios seen in the ocean.

N2  - Net energy accumulation by marine microalgae at very low photon fluxes involves modulation of several attributes related to both the growth and photosynthetic physiology of these organisms. Here we studied flash-induced oscillatory patterns in oxygen evolution by previously dark-adapted cells of the green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta (Butcher) and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Bohlin). The activity of the oxygen-evolving complex was found to be species-specific and influenced by photoacclimation. Results from measurements of oxygen flash yield obtained for these organisms grown under light-saturating conditions are directly comparable to those previously reported in the literature for other microalgae and higher plants. However, similar measurements on cells grown in low-light and/or light-starved conditions indicate an increased level of backward transitions (double misses) leading to the formation of super-reduced states (i.e. S-1 and S-2). Thus, in this communication, we present the first evidence that super-reduced states can be generated in vivo and speculate, on how they may be physiologically important.

N2  - Modulation of activin and other TGF beta superfamily signaling is the primary mechanism of action for both follistatin (FS) and FS-like 3 (FSTL-3). However, most studies of these ligands use activin A due to its wide availability. We have now tested the ability of FS288 and FSTL-3 to bind and neutralize activin B relative to activin A. Activin B bound to both FS and FSTL-3 at a potency approximately 10-fold lower than that of activin A. Moreover, whereas both activins had similar biological activity in 293 cell reporter assays, FS and FSTL-3 were approximately 3-fold more effective in neutralizing activin A relative to activin B. These results suggest that neutralization of activins A and B by FS and FSTL-3 are not identical, so that the relative activity of each activin in tissues where both are produced, such as in the ovary, could be quite different. In addition, biological systems that use primarily activin B, but which have been examined in vitro using activin A, may need to be reevaluated to determine the actual physiologic roles of FS or FSTL-3.

N2  - The rostrum is a large diameter, thin-walled tubular structure that receives loads from the teeth. The rostrum can be conceptualized both as a rigid structure and as an assemblage of several bones that interface at sutures. Using miniature pigs, we measured in vivo strains in rostral bones and sutures to gain a better understanding of how the rostrum behaves biomechanically. Strains in the premaxillary and nasal bones were low but the adjacent maxillary-premaxillary, internasal, and intermaxillary suture strains were larger by an order of magnitude. While this finding emphasizes the composite nature of the rostrum, we also found evidence in the maxillary and nasal bones for rigid structural behavior. Namely, maxillary strain is consistent with a short beam model under shear deformation from molar loading. Strain in the nasal bones is only partially supported by a long beam model; rather, a complex pattern of dorsal bending of the rostrum from incisor contact and lateral compression is suggested. Torsion of the maxilla is ruled out due to the bilateral occlusion of pigs and the similar working and balancing side strains, although it may be important in mammals with a unilateral bite. Torsional loading does appear important in the premaxillae, which demonstrate working and balancing side changes in strain orientation. These differences are attributed to asymmetrical incisor contact occurring at the end of the power stroke.

N2  - Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR was used to analyze the temporal and spatial intraspecific diversity of 208 Vibrio vulnificus strains isolated from Galveston Bay water and oysters at five different sites between June 2000 and June 2001. V. vulnificus was not detected during the winter months (December through February). The densities of V. vulnificus in water and oysters were positively correlated with water temperature. Cluster analysis of RAPD PCR profiles of the 208 V. vulnificus isolates revealed a high level of intraspecific diversity among the strains. No correlation was found between the intraspecific diversity among the isolates and sampling site or source of isolation. After not being detected during the winter months, the genetic diversity of V. vulnificus strains first isolated in March was 0.9167. Beginning in April, a higher level of intraspecific diversity (0.9933) and a major shift in population structure were observed among V. vulnificus isolates. These results suggest that a great genetic diversity of V. vulnificus strains exists in Galveston Bay water and oysters and that the population structure of this species is linked to changes in environmental conditions, especially temperature.

N2  - <jats:p> While theorists and practitioners consistently call for widespread participation in ecosystem management and environmental planning in general, few studies have empirically tested the assumption that community representation and stakeholder participation during the planning process will lead to stronger, more durable management plans. This article examines the impact of stakeholder representation and participation on ecosystem management strategies. It tests the relationship between community participation in the planning process and the quality of local plans associated with the long-term management of ecological systems. Besides the overall breadth of stakeholder groups involved in planning, the effects of specific stakeholders are tested and discussed to determine which has the greatest impact on the quality of an adopted plan. Statistical results indicate that the presence of specific stakeholders does in fact significantly increase ecosystem plans' quality. Policy implications are discussed to more effectively link the planning process to high-quality ecosystem planning outcomes. </jats:p>

N2  - Abstract The partial sequence (600 bp) containing the most variable region of Vibrio vulnificus 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was determined for 208 randomly selected V. vulnificus strains isolated from Galveston Bay, TX, USA between June 2000 and June 2001. A comparative analysis of the determined partial 16S rDNA sequences revealed the existence of two different partial 16S rDNA sequences (type A and type B, 1.3% base substitutions) among the 208 V. vulnificus isolates. A higher proportion of 16S rDNA type A strains was isolated in June and July while a considerably higher proportion of type B strains was isolated in September. In addition, after no V. vulnificus strains were detected during the winter months (December-February), only type A strains were isolated during the following months (March-May). The results suggest that the relative abundance of type A and type B V. vulnificus strains in Galveston Bay varies with the season and that the differences between the two 16S rDNA types may affect the viability of these organisms in the natural environment.

N2  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and in situ fluorescence were measured along with hydrographic parameters in the Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian Seas (Nordic Seas). Surface (<100 m) concentrations of DOC ranged from 60 to 118 μM with elevated values in the East Greenland Current (EGC) which transports water from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic. EGC surface waters also showed a pronounced fluorescence maximum between 30 and 120 m depth in all EGC sections indicating the abundance of Arctic river derived DOC in this current. Based on fluorescence we estimated that 20-50% of the annual river discharge to the Arctic Ocean was exported in the EGC. The fluorescence maximum was typically associated with salinity around 33 and temperatures below - 1°C which are characteristic of surface and upper halocline water in the Arctic Ocean. The elevated fluorescence in this water mass suggests a strong Eurasian shelf component and also suggests that in situ fluorescence could be used to trace Eurasian shelf water in the central Arctic Ocean. DOC concentrations in the Nordic Sea basins (>1000 m) were relatively high (∼50 μM DOC) compared with other ocean basins indicating active vertical transport of DOC in this region on decadal timescales. Based on existing vertical transport estimates and 15 μM of semilabile DOC we calculated an annual vertical net DOC export of 3.5 Tg C yr-1 in the Greenland Sea and about 36 Tg C yr-1 for the entire Arctic Mediterranean Sea (AMS) including the Greenland-Scotland Ridge overflow. It appears that physical processes play a determining role for the distribution of DOC in the AMS.

N2  - While ecosystem approaches to management often necessitate the participation of key stakeholders during the plan-making process, few empirical studies have focused on the role of industry. Large resource-based industries not only have the greatest impact on critical natural resources, but also own much of the land base and critical habitat in the United States. This article examines the impact of resource-based industries in Florida on ecosystem management strategies and environmental planning in general. Specifically, it tests the relationship between industry participation in the planning process and the quality of local plans associated with managing ecological systems over the long term. Results indicate that the presence of industry during the planning process significantly raises the quality of adopted plans associated with managing ecological systems.

N2  - Phytoplankton is a nineteenth century ecological construct for a biologically diverse group of pelagic photoautotrophs that share common metabolic functions but not evolutionary histories. In contrast to terrestrial plants, a major schism occurred in the evolution of the eukaryotic phytoplankton that gave rise to two major plastid superfamilies. The green superfamily appropriated chlorophyll b, whereas the red superfamily uses chlorophyll c as an accessory photosynthetic pigment. Fossil evidence suggests that the green superfamily dominated Palaeozoic oceans. However, after the end-Permian extinction, members of the red superfamily rose to ecological prominence. The processes responsible for this shift are obscure. Here we present an analysis of major nutrients and trace elements in 15 species of marine phytoplankton from the two superfamilies. Our results indicate that there are systematic phylogenetic differences in the two plastid types where macronutrient (carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus) stoichiometries primarily reflect ancestral pre-symbiotic host cell phenotypes, but trace element composition reflects differences in the acquired plastids. The compositional differences between the two plastid superfamilies suggest that changes in ocean redox state strongly influenced the evolution and selection of eukaryotic phytoplankton since the Proterozoic era.

N2  - Empirical evidence of chaos, or complex behavior, in ecosystems is scarce, presumably due to high system-level noise and/or the rarity of conditions necessary for complex behavior to arise. An alternative explanation might be that complex behavior is fragile and readily suppressed by disturbances that are common in many ecosystems. Here we investigated the role of disturbance frequency and magnitude on complex behavior and focused on population succession trajectories in a plankton system. Because of its prominence in aquatic ecology, we used hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading as disturbances. Our findings from numerical modeling exercises and laboratory microcosm experiments using natural plankton assemblages indicated that one aspect of complex behavior, divergence of nearby trajectories, was suppressed when the magnitude and periodicity of hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading were large. In other words, complex succession became determinable. Divergence of nearby trajectories was relatively robust, however, because pulses of not less than 85% of the total inflow were required to suppress this behavior. Our numerical findings also revealed that large hydraulic disturbances could introduce to the system another aspect of complex behavior, aperiodic succession.

N2  - Pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) have an elevated mitochondrial volume density [VV(mt)] and elevated citrate synthase (CS) and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) activities in their swimming muscles to maintain an aerobic, fat-based metabolism during diving. The goal of this study was to determine whether the heart, kidneys and splanchnic organs have an elevated VV(mt) and CS and HOAD activities as parallel adaptations for sustaining aerobic metabolism and normal function during hypoxia in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). Samples of heart, liver, kidney, stomach and small intestine were taken from 10 freshly killed harbor seals and fixed in glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopy or frozen in liquid nitrogen for enzymatic analysis. Samples from dogs and rats were used for comparison. Within the harbor seal, the liver and stomach had the highest VV(mt). The liver also had the highest CS activity. The kidneys and heart had the highest HOAD activities, and the liver and heart had the highest lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. Mitochondrial volume densities scaled to tissue-specific resting metabolic rate [VV(mt)/RMR] in the heart, liver, kidneys, stomach and small intestine of harbor seals were elevated (range 1.2-6.6x) when compared with those in the dog and/or rat. In addition, HOAD activity scaled to tissue-specific RMR in the heart and liver of harbor seals was elevated compared with that in the dog and rat (3.2x and 6.2x in the heart and 8.5x and 5.5x in the liver, respectively). These data suggest that organs such as the liver, kidneys and stomach possess a heightened ability for aerobic, fat-based metabolism during hypoxia associated with routine diving. However, a heightened LDH activity in the heart and liver indicates an adaptation for the anaerobic production of ATP on dives that exceed the animal's aerobic dive limit. Hence, the heart, liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal organs of harbor seals exhibit adaptations that promote an aerobic, fat-based metabolism under hypoxic conditions but can provide ATP anaerobically if required.

N2  - Basal performance, volume loading response and oxygen consumption were determined in a resistance-headed preparation of the isolated trout heart. Two groups of hearts were used: the +CF group, in which the coronary vascular tree was perfused with a flow directly related to the pressure generated by the heart, and the -CF group, in which the coronary flow was set to zero. As a criterion for setting basal performance, the atrial input pressure was set in order to induce the ventricle to produce a cardiac output of 15 ml min(-1) kg(-1). Once basal conditions were obtained, the preparation was perfused for 30 min, and atrial and aortic pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, coronary pressure and coronary flow were determined at 5 min intervals. At the onset of perfusion, there was no difference in the basal performance between the two groups: the same preload was necessary to get the same cardiac output in both perfusion groups. None of the other performance parameters determined were different. However, after only 5 min of perfusion, the -CF hearts displayed significant adjustments, with increased atrial preload and ventricular preload (mean atrial pressure), and a significant decrease in cardiac output. At the end of the 30 min basal perfusion period, hearts were challenged with a stepwise increase in preload in order to obtain maximal stroke work (volume loading). The effect of coronary perfusion on the heart's response to volume loading was highly significant: the stroke work-preload relationship was significantly shifted towards higher preload values in the -CF group. Also, the maximal work produced by the heart under the experimental conditions used was lower in the -CF group. Rate of oxygen consumption of the heart increased significantly with volume loading, from a basal value of approximately 20 microl O2 min(-1) g(-1) to approx. 40 microl O2 min(-1) g(-1), but was not significantly affected by the absence of coronary perfusion. Mechanical efficiency under basal conditions was approximately 17%, but was not affected by either volume loading or coronary perfusion. Taken as a whole, these data represent direct evidence of the effect of coronary perfusion on the mechanical performance of the trout heart, but also show that these effects are limited by significant self-adjustments that occur in the heart.

N2  - There is strong evidence that pinnipeds maintain a lipid-based, aerobic metabolism during diving. However, the few fiber-typing studies performed on pinniped skeletal muscles are not consistent with an aerobic physiological profile. The objective of this study was to reexamine the fiber type distribution throughout the primary locomotory muscles of the harbor seal Phoca vitulina. Results from immunohistochemical (IHC) fiber typing indicated that harbor seal swimming muscles (the epaxial muscles) are composed of 47.4% type I (slow twitch, oxidative) fibers and 52.8% IIa (fast twitch, oxidative) fibers, which are homogeneously distributed throughout the muscle. Harbor seal pectoralis, a secondary swimming muscle, was composed of 16.2% type I and 84.3% type IIa fibers. No fast twitch, glycolytic (type IIb) fibers were detected in either muscle, in contrast to published data on fiber typing of harbor seal epaxial muscles using traditional histochemical techniques. The extreme specificity inherent in the IHC fiber typing procedure leads us to conclude that harbor seal swimming muscle is entirely composed of oxidative fibers. Our results are consistent with the enzymatic analyses of pinniped skeletal muscle that support the use of lipid-derived aerobic catabolism to fuel working muscle during diving in these marine mammals.

N2  - A new scheme to model surface erosion of bottom sediment in tidal estuaries is demonstrated in this paper. The erosion or resuspension scheme used accounts for the sediment deposition and erosion history based on an empirical formulation, which relates critical shear stress for erosion (τc) to accumulated eroded mass. A point model, which does not consider advection and diffusion, is built to test the scheme and explore the parameters involved. The results show that sediment concentration reaches 10 mg l-1 with an amplitude of tidal current 0.15 m s-1, and 34 mg l-1 with an amplitude of tidal current 0.30 m s-1 in a 2.5 m water depth. Such values are representative in shallow areas of Baltimore Harbor where the empirical equation was obtained. Compared to the traditional way of using a constant τc in a sediment transport model, this scheme allows sediment resuspension to occur at places where bed shear stress is low, since as long as there is freshly deposited materials at the bed, erosion starts at low critical shear stress. The scheme is then incorporated into a three-dimensional numerical sediment transport model. The magnitude of simulated sediment concentrations agrees well with the observation data.

N2  - <jats:p> Research examining the quality of local planning often treats planning problems as isolated incidents occurring in public decision making. Comprehensive plans and policy statements are evolving instruments, undergoing continual revisions. This article examines the degree to which the quality of local plans changes over an eight-year period with respect to natural hazards mitigation. Jurisdictions in Florida and Washington were sampled in 1991 and in 1999 to determine the extent to which their plans’ hazard mitigation components changed and to identify factors driving communities to adopt stronger policies. Results indicate the plans of local jurisdictions improved and that legal reform, repetitive damage to property, and citizen participation can facilitate an adaptive learning process. This article discusses policy implications and provides recommendations for improving learning capabilities to prepare plans that prevent natural hazards. </jats:p>

N2  - Because ecosystem approaches to management adhere to ecological systems rather than human-defined boundaries, collaboration across jurisdiction, agencies, and land ownership is often necessary to achieve effective management of transboundary resources. Local natural resource and land use planners increasingly recognize that while ecosystem management requires looking beyond specific jurisdictions and focusing on broad spatial scales, the approach will partly be implemented at the local level with the coordination of local policies across larger landscapes. This article evaluates the collective capabilities of local jurisdictions to manage large transboundary ecological systems in Florida. Specifically, it combines plan evaluation with geographic information systems (GIS) techniques to map, measure, and analyze the existing mosaic of management across selected ecosystems in the southern portion of the State. Visual and statistical results indicate significant gaps in the management framework of southern Florida that, if filled, could achieve a greater level of consistency and more complete coverage of ecosystem management policies. Based on the spatial distribution of 58 ecosystem management indicators, notable gaps persist in the southwest coast, southeast coast, and central Everglades ecosystems, particularly for wildlife corridors and collaboration with neighboring jurisdictions. We also test for spatial autocorrelation of ecosystem planning scores and find that local jurisdictions with strong ecosystem management capabilities tend to cluster within specific ecosystems. Based on the findings, we make recommendations on how and where local plans can be strengthened to more effectively attain the objectives of ecosystem approaches to management.

N2  - This is a design project of an air-filter sensor to be used in home heating and cooling system. The project includes conceptual design, analysis, implementation, tests and modifications. First, the air quality and power consumption between a clean air filter and a dirty air filter is studied. Then, a photo sensor circuit with an ultra high brightness LED emitter and a phototransistor receiver is used to detect dust particles. A red warning LED lights up when a specified amount of dust is collected on the filter and blocks the light beam between the emitter and the receiver. The emitter and receiver are mounted on a simple fixture and can be easily fitted on any air filter. In addition, the cost analysis shows that this design can significantly reduce the electricity bill if the filters are properly replaced.

N2  - 234Th, a commonly used short-lived particle-reactive tracer in marine systems, was measured in three different holding pond series at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), Colorado, along with its parent nuclide 238U, to determine steady-state residence times of particle-reactive actinides such as Pu, and of particles. Series B ponds, which received industrial effluent that includes ortho-phosphate (PO4) and actinides, differed from series A and C ponds, which did not. This difference was also evident in the calculated particle residence times, which were <1 day for the ponds B4 and B5, where PO4 concentrations were higher (1.4 and 1.8 mg/l), and 3 and 3.4 days for ponds A3 and C2, respectively, where ortho-phosphate concentrations were lower (<0.1 mg/l). Particle residence times thus showed an inverse relationship with the concentration of ortho-phosphate, the limiting nutrient in fresh water systems. The same relationship to the concentration of ortho-phosphate or any of the other nutrient elements was not evident for the residence times of dissolved 234Th, which ranged between 0.1 and 2 days. This can be attributed to higher concentrations of dissolved and particulate ligands with greater binding potential for actinides such as four-valent Th and Pu in ponds with higher ortho-phosphate concentrations. Regardless of actual ortho-phosphate concentration, however, at water residence (holding) times of 1 month in these ponds, particles and associated actinides would be expected to be completely removed from the pond water to sediments.

N2  - Foraging by mammals is a complex suite of behaviors that can entail high energetic costs associated with supporting basal metabolism, locomotion and the digestion of prey. To determine the contribution of these various costs in a free-ranging marine mammal, we measured the post-dive oxygen consumption of adult Weddell seals (N=9) performing foraging and non-foraging dives from an isolated ice hole in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Dives were classified according to behavior as monitored by an attached video-data logging system (recording activity, time, depth, velocity and stroking). We found that recovery oxygen consumption showed a biphasic relationship with dive duration that corresponded to the onset of plasma lactate accumulation at approximately 23 min. Locomotor costs for diving Weddell seals increased linearly with the number of strokes taken according to the relationship: locomotor cost = -3.78+0.04 x stroke number (r(2)=0.74, N=90 dives), where locomotor cost is in ml O(2) kg(-1). Foraging dives in which seals ingested Pleuragramma antarcticum resulted in a 44.7% increase in recovery oxygen consumption compared to non-foraging dives, which we attributed to the digestion and warming of prey. The results show that the energy expended in digestion for a free-ranging marine mammal are additive to locomotor and basal costs. By accounting for each of these costs and monitoring stroking mechanics, it is possible to estimate the aerobic cost of diving in free-ranging seals where cryptic behavior and remote locations prevent direct energetic measurements.

N2  - <jats:p> In the past, researchers in the field of environmental psychology have explained environmental perceptions primarily through socioeconomic and demographic factors. However, knowledge of and support for protecting specific natural features of the landscape should also be influenced by one’s location, setting, and proximity to such features. This article focuses on residents’familiarity with and concern for two creeks passing through San Antonio, TX. Using Geographic Information Systems analytical techniques, we expand on previous studies by introducing driving distance from the creeks to identify the effects of this location-based variable on environmental perceptions. Specifically, we test the degree to which the actual driving distance respondents live from two creeks affects respondents’ knowledge and perceptions of the water bodies. We show that when controlling for socioeconomic and geographic contextual variables, the residential distance variable remains a significant factor in explaining both familiarity with the creeks and views on the level of water pollution in them. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of incorporating proximity factors in watershed planning and policy. </jats:p>

N2  - Iodine is a biophilic element, with several short-lived isotopes (e.g. (131)I, t(1/2)=8 days), one long-lived isotope, (129)I (t(1/2)=15.6 million years) and one stable isotope, (127)I. The inventory of (129)I in surface environments has been overwhelmed by anthropogenic releases over the past 50 years. Iodine and its isotopes are important for a number of reasons: (1) The largest fraction of the short-term and long-term dose from accidental releases and fallout from atomic bomb tests was from iodine isotopes. (2) (129)I is one of the two long-lived nuclides with highest mobility in stored radioactive waste. (3) (129)I could provide the scientific community with a new geochemical tracer and new geochronological applications in environmental science. (4) A better assessment of iodine deficiency disorders, mineralization in exploration geochemistry, and the transfer of volatile organic greenhouse-active and ozone-destroying iodine species from the oceans to the atmosphere is needed. One of the most promising future applications for the (129)I/(127)I ratio is not only as a new geochronometer, but also as a new source tracer for terrestrial organic matter with ages of 50 years or less. This is especially attractive, since radiocarbon can be, at times, an ambiguous chronometer for the 50-year time-scale, whereas (129)I concentrations during this time are overwhelming previous levels by orders of magnitude. Iodine is to a significant extent involved in the cycle of organic matter in all surface environments. Its biophilic nature is demonstrated by a relative enrichment of iodine in seaweed and dissolved macromolecular organic matter. Because of the close coupling of iodine and organic carbon cycles, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of the processes regulating iodination reactions in aquatic systems is still limited. The binding of iodine by organic matter has the potential to modify the transport, bioavailability and transfer of iodine isotopes to man. Equilibration times for (129)I in many reservoirs are likely long enough that (129)I could be used as a new source tracer for organic matter of terrestrial origin, and as a geochronometer. Current tracer applications of (129)I are limited by our knowledge of the effects of UV-radiation, microbial activity and geochemical redox conditions on organo-I compounds and overall iodine speciation. The biogeochemical behavior of iodine and its isotopes appears to be different in North America and European waters, possibly due to climatic, source and speciation differences.

N2  - We evaluated the effects of nutrient addition on interactions between the benthic microalgal community and a dominant herbivorous gastropod, Cerithidea californica (California horn snail), on tidal flats in Mugu Lagoon, southern California, USA. We crossed snail and nutrient (N and P) addition treatments in enclosures on two tidal flats varying from 71 to 92% sand content in a temporally replicated experiment (summer 2000, fall 2000, spring 2001). Diatom biomass increased slightly (approximately 30%) in response to nutrient treatments but was not affected by snails. Blooms of cyanobacteria (up to 200%) and purple sulfur bacteria (up to 400%) occurred in response to nutrient enrichment, particularly in the sandier site, but only cyanobacterial biomass decreased in response to snail grazing. Snail mortality was 2-5 times higher in response to nutrient addition, especially in the sandier site, corresponding to a relative increase in cyanobacterial biomass. Nutrient-related snail mortality occurred only in the spring and summer, when the snails were most actively feeding on the microalgal community. Inactive snails in the fall showed no response to nutrient-induced cyanobacterial growths. This study demonstrated strongly negative upward cascading effects of nutrient enrichment through the food chain. The strength of this upward cascade was closely linked to sediment type and microalgal community composition.

N2  - The sustainable management of coastal natural resources inevitably involves identifying stakeholder conflicts and developing planning processes that prevent these conflicts from becoming intractable disputes. This study links environmental conflict to specific areas within a large ecological system. Specifically, we use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map potentially competing stakeholder values associated with establishing protected areas in Matagorda Bay, Texas. By overlaying multiple values associated with a range of stakeholders across space, we are able to identify hotspots of potential conflict as well as areas of opportunity for maximizing joint gains. Mapping stakeholder conflict is an approach to proactively locate potential controversy in response to a specific environmental management proposal and guide decision makers in crafting planning processes that mitigate the possibility of intractable disputes and facilitate the implementation of sustainable coastal policies. Results indicate that under different management scenarios, protected area proposals will generate more conflict in specific areas. Most notably, regulated uses would produce the greatest degree of conflict on or near shore, particularly at the mouth of the Colorado River. Additionally, of all the management scenarios evaluated, the prohibition of coastal structural development would generate the overall highest level of conflict within the Bay. Based on the results, we discuss the policy implications for environmental managers and provide guidance for future research on location-based conflict management within the coastal margin.

N2  - When aquatic reptiles, birds and mammals submerge, they typically exhibit a dive response in which breathing ceases, heart rate slows, and blood flow to peripheral tissues is reduced. The profound dive response that occurs during forced submergence sequesters blood oxygen for the brain and heart while allowing peripheral tissues to become anaerobic, thus protecting the animal from immediate asphyxiation. However, the decrease in peripheral blood flow is in direct conflict with the exercise response necessary for supporting muscle metabolism during submerged swimming. In free diving animals, a dive response still occurs, but it is less intense than during forced submergence, and whole-body metabolism remains aerobic. If blood oxygen is not sequestered for brain and heart metabolism during normal diving, then what is the purpose of the dive response? Here, we show that its primary role may be to regulate the degree of hypoxia in skeletal muscle so that blood and muscle oxygen stores can be efficiently used. Paradoxically, the muscles of diving vertebrates must become hypoxic to maximize aerobic dive duration. At the same time, morphological and enzymatic adaptations enhance intracellular oxygen diffusion at low partial pressures of oxygen. Optimizing the use of blood and muscle oxygen stores allows aquatic, air-breathing vertebrates to exercise for prolonged periods while holding their breath.

N2  - The community structure and ecological function of contemporary marine ecosystems are critically dependent on eukaryotic phytoplankton. Although numerically inferior to cyanobacteria, these organisms are responsible for the majority of the flux of organic matter to higher trophic levels and the ocean interior. Photosynthetic eukaryotes evolved more than 1.5 billion years ago in the Proterozoic oceans. However, it was not until the Mesozoic Era (251 to 65 million years ago) that the three principal phytoplankton clades that would come to dominate the modern seas rose to ecological prominence. In contrast to their pioneering predecessors, the dinoflagellates, coccolithophores, and diatoms all contain plastids derived from an ancestral red alga by secondary symbiosis. Here we examine the geological, geochemical, and biological processes that contributed to the rise of these three, distantly related, phytoplankton groups.

N2  - Dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations were measured and annual loads estimated for the Trinity River, the main freshwater input source to Galveston Bay, which lies on the upper Gulf coast of Texas, USA, during 2000-2001. This river drains the forested lowlands south of a relatively large reservoir lake, Lake Livingston. A weak relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Q(TR) indicated hydrologic control but separation of the data, based on individual discharge events, was necessary to improve interpretation. For instance, the first rain of the season resulted in only a modest increase in DOC concentrations and led to an inverse relationship with discharge, due to decreased lateral flow and increased infiltration of rainwater, with the lower flows being more efficient at DOC leaching from soils. In contrast, a long duration high discharge river crest event resulted in an opposite trend, i.e. a linear increase in DOC with increasing discharge rates. A short duration high discharge tropical storm showed reduced Trinity River DOC concentrations and the highest POC concentrations measured, likely resulting from the relatively short duration, and minimal contact time, of this event. In contrast to DOC, the concentrations of particulate organic carbon, POC (mg C l(-1)) were linearly correlated to suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations and accounted for between 10 and 12% of the total suspended load at low discharge but decreased to approximately 2% at high discharge. This suggests dilution by larger particles with a reduced organic carbon content, possibly silicate minerals, more readily resuspended at elevated levels of discharge. The annual total organic carbon (TOC) load to Galveston Bay, estimated from the slope of the daily load vs. discharge relationship, was 11.2 x 10(10) g C and calculated export coefficients (g C m(-2) year(-1)) were in good agreement with previous results. Using this relationship, accurate assessments of TOC flux inputs to Galveston Bay over the past quarter-century and in the future are possible by obtaining annual Trinity River discharge rates, which are readily available from the USGS. Comparing DOC riverine inputs to benthic sources in Trinity Bay, measured directly on the same day, indicates that the sediments contribute approximately 20% of total inputs of DOC to Trinity Bay. However, assuming a constant benthic source during low-flow conditions, which can occur for periods of up to 14 months in this region of Texas, benthic fluxes would account for > 80% of the total inputs into Trinity Bay. At high levels of discharge, the Trinity River discharges approximately 1.0 x 10(9) g C day(-1) and dominates DOC inputs to Trinity Bay.

N2  - We collected the following six species of Sipuncula in three intertidal and shallow subtidal sites around Twin Cays from April 18-24, 2003: Golfingia elongata (Keferstein, 1862); Siphonosoma cumanense (Keferstein, 1867); Sipunculus nudus Linnaeus, 1766; Aspidosiphon (Paraspidosiphon) fischeri ten Broeke, 1925; Aspidosiphon (Paraspidosiphon) laevis de Quatrefages, 1865; and Aspidosiphon (Paraspidosiphon) parvulus Gerould, 1913. Of these, Golfingia elongata and Aspidosiphon parvulus were the most common ones, both collected from mangrove and Thalassia root mats. The distribution of Golfingia elongata seemed patchy. Sipunculus nudus and Siphonosoma cumanense were found in low density in consolidated sand flats. In total, 14 sipunculan species are reported from Carrie Bow Cay and surrounding cays. We include a key to all the species found in the area.

N2  - The supply of water to the Nueces River Delta near Corpus Christi, Texas is limited by dams and channelization of the river which restrict freshwater inflow. The upper end (high marsh) of the delta frequently dries up during the summer. The marsh consists of slightly elevated islands containing emergent halophytes, and shallow ponds interconnected by narrow channels. Carbon dioxide exchange in the marsh was measured by relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) during two periods, one in 1997 that included two floods from the river followed by an extended period of drying and disappearance of standing water, and the other in 1998 that was in the midst of a drought with no standing water present. The marsh was a net CO2 sink during periods of high water availability and low sediment salinity, and a net source when water availability was low and salinity was high. During the 1997 period, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) ranged from -7.3 g CO2 m -2 per day (net gain of CO2) and 12.3 g CO2 m-2 per day, respectively, after flooding to +8.7 g CO2 m-2 per day (net loss of CO2) and 0.4 g CO2 m-2 per day, respectively, when sediments were dry. NEE and GEP averaged 0.5 and 7.7 g CO2 m-2 per day, respectively, during this period. Standing water, and water in pores restricted gas exchange between sediment and the atmosphere so that ecosystem respiration (R) increased as the marsh dried, with R ranging from 1.2 to 15.6 g CO2 m -2 per day and averaging 8.2 g CO2 m-2 per day. During the 1998 drought, NEE, GEP, and R averaged 5.8, 3.3, and 9.1 g CO 2 m-2 per day, respectively. A 27 mm rain during this period produced a 14-fold increase in GEP and a 75% reduction in R that lasted for 2 days. In 1997, NEE and its components were all significantly correlated at the 0.05 level with water availability as estimated by the cumulative difference between rainfall and evaporation, while in 1998, only NEE and GEP were significantly correlated with water availability. Results of this study indicate that the marsh NEE behaved more like that of a dryland ecosystem than a wetland because of limited freshwater inflow. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Sequence analysis of the mtDNA control region of four samples (n=195) of Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda) collected along the northern Mediterranean reveals two clades about 8.1% divergent distributed in an east-west cline that fits an isolation by distance (IBD) model. The vicariant origin of this genetic discontinuity is proposed, supported in addition to the cline, by evidence of distinct historical demographic factors affecting each clade. Variation in Clade I suggests a large stable population, whereas Clade II displays a star-like phylogeny indicative of a population bottleneck followed by sudden expansion. The historical demography and biogeographic scenario is as follows: (1) Allopatric isolation during the Pleistocene give rise to Clade I (Atlantic) and Clade II (Mediterranean); (2) Population collapse followed by sudden expansion gives rise to the characteristic star-like phylogeny of Clade II; (3) Secondary contact as Clade I enters from the Atlantic, and (4) An east-west cline is maintained by IBD.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is twofold: to describe the water quality model of Three-Dimensional Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model (HEM-3D) and to present an application of HEM-3D to a coastal system in Korea. HEM-3D, listed as a tool for the development of Total Maximum Daily Load by US Environmental Protection Agency, is a general-purpose modeling package for simulation of the flow field, transport, and eutrophication processes throughout the water column and of diagenetic processes in the benthic sediment. This paper describes the water quality model of HEM-3D with emphasis on its unique features. Excessive loadings of organic wastes have significantly deteriorated water quality conditions of Korean coastal waters. This paper presents an application of HEM-3D to Kwang-Yang Bay, a coastal system in Korea, which is one of the first water quality modeling efforts for Korean coastal waters accompanied by a relatively comprehensive field program. The current status of data availability for water quality modeling in Korea is discussed.

N2  - Ice cores from glaciers situated near anthropogenic sources of air pollution provide important archives of the emissions of species with short atmospheric lifetimes. Here we present the history of atmospheric Pu fallout reconstructed from an ice core from the Belukha glacier in the Siberian Altai. Fourteen ice core samples covering the time period 1941-1986 were selected for Pu analysis, chemically processed, and measured using accelerator mass spectrometry. The Pu concentration peaks in 1963, coinciding with the maximum of the nuclear weapons tests and in concordance with the 3H activity concentration peak. The shapes of the 239Pu and 3H profiles reflect two main periods of atmospheric nuclear test activity: premoratorium testing before 1958 and postmoratorium testing in 1961 and 1962. Premoratorium tests contribute about 45% of the integrated Pu inventory. The average 240Pu/239Pu isotopic ratio is 0.18 +/- 0.05, indicating that a large majority of the Pu in the Belukha glacier originates from global stratospheric fallout rather than from direct tropospheric input.

N2  - Environmental and human health issues associated with outdoor air pollution, such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, and other pollutants in metropolitan regions, are an area of growing concern for both policy officials and the general public. Increasing attention from the news media, new health data, and public debate over the effectiveness of clean air regulations have raised the importance of air quality in the public consciousness. While public perceptions of air quality have been studied thoroughly dating back to the 1960s, little empirical research has been conducted to explain the spatial aspects of these perceptions, particularly at the local level. Although recent studies suggest characteristics of local setting are important in shaping perceptions of air quality, the roles of proximity, neighborhood characteristics, and location have not been clarified. This study seeks to improve understanding of the major factors shaping public perceptions of air quality by examining the spatial pattern of local risk perception, the role of socioeconomic characteristics in forming these perceptions, and the relationship between perceived and scientifically measured air pollution. First, we map the spatial pattern of local air quality perceptions using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) across the Dallas and Houston metropolitan areas. Next, we explain these perceptions through local contextual factors using both bivariate correlations and multivariate regression analysis. Results indicate that perceptions of air quality in the study areas are not significantly correlated with air quality based on readings of air monitoring stations. Instead, perceptions appear to be influenced by setting (urban vs. rural), state identification, access to information, and socioeconomic characteristics such as age, race, and political identification. We discuss the implications of the findings and provide direction on how further research can provide a deeper understanding of the local contextual factors influencing public perceptions.

N2  - <jats:p>Lean Manufacturing is a powerful philosophy, which advocates minimization of waste throughout the value stream both within the organization and enterprise which includes the supply chain. A concept, which was first used by automobile manufacturers to enhance their operational efficiencies, Lean focuses on driving out non-value added activities from a company’s operation, while streamlining its value added activities. A number of companies in the United States have adopted the Lean Manufacturing philosophy to reduce cost and increase efficiency. To augment the existing training programs five new simulation tools in Ship Design Processes, Supply Chain Integration, Ship Repair Processes, Value Stream Mapping and Scheduling were developed under a grant from National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) by Old Dominion University, Northrop Grumman Newport News and South Tidewater Association of Ship Repairers. The paper will discuss the design, development and implementation of two of these new simulation tools.</jats:p>

N2  - Vibrissal follicle-sinus complexes (F-SCs) are sensory receptors of the mammalian integument system. They are best developed within Pinnipedia. The objective of this study was to investigate the F-SCs of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) for benthic foraging adaptations. Bearded seals possessed approximately 244 mystacial F-SCs. In this species, F-SCs consisted of an outer dermal capsule (DC) surrounding a blood sinus system [upper cavernous sinus (UCS), ring sinus (RS), and lower cavernous sinus (LCS)] and concentric rings of epidermal tissue. The UCS comprised up to 62% of the F-SC length and may function as thermal protection for mechanoreceptors. A large asymmetrical ringwulst was located in the RS. A deep vibrissal nerve penetrated the DC at its base and terminated on mechanoreceptors in the epidermal tissues of the LCS and RS. The mean number of myelinated axons per F-SC was 1,314 (range, 811-1,650) and was among the highest number of axons per F-SC reported to date. An estimated mean number of 320,616 myelinated axons innervate the entire mystacial vibrissal array. Merkel-Neurite complexes (MNCs) and small simple laminated corpuscles were found in the region of the LCS. Myelinated axons also terminated on MNCs and lanceolate endings apical to the ringwulst. The number of F-SCs, their geometry in the mystacial region, the number of myelinated axons per F-SC, and the distribution of mechanoreceptors support the premise that pinniped vibrissae are sensitive active-touch receptor systems, and that structural differences in bearded seals, relative to other phocids, may be adaptations for benthic foraging.

N2  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The thermal oxidation of aluminum nitride was developed as a means to study defects in bulk aluminum nitride crystals. The oxidation kinetics was established for the dry oxidation of highly textured AlN polycrystals produced by sublimation-recombination crystal growth in a tungsten furnace. Despite seeding on polycrystalline tungsten, the grains were predominantly [0001] oriented as verified by electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD). The oxidation rate is dependent on the crystal’s orientation, polarity, stress, and surface condition, thus oxidation decorates grain boundaries, polishing scratches, and inversion domains by producing oxide layers of different thicknesses. The initial oxidation rate of nitrogen polar (0001) AlN is approximately 25% faster than on aluminum polar crystals. Low temperature (800 °C) dry oxidation produced an amorphous oxide layer and generated a high density of defects (vacancies, stacking faults, and dislocations) in the nitride near the oxide/nitride interface, as observed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. In contrast, high temperature oxidation (1000 °C) produced a crystalline oxide layer, and left the nitride free of observable defects.</jats:p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Yellowfin and skipjack tuna are globally distributed in the world's tropical and sub-tropical oceans. Since little, if any, migration of these fishes occurs between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans, one might expect to see genetic differences between sub-populations in these ocean basins. However, yellowfin and skipjack tuna have extremely large population sizes. Thus, the rate of genetic drift should be slower than that observed for other tunas. RESULTS: Low levels of genetic differentiation were observed between Atlantic and Pacific samples of yellowfin tuna. In contrast, no genetic differentiation was observed between Atlantic and Pacific samples of skipjack tuna. CONCLUSION: Much lower levels of genetic differentiation were found among sub-populations of yellowfin tuna compared to those observed for other large tunas, probably due to the large population size of yellowfin tuna. Since skipjack tuna appear to have even larger population sizes, it is not surprising that no genetic differentiation was detected between Atlantic and Pacific samples of these fish.

N2  - The orbicularis oris and buccinator muscles of mammals form an important subset of the facial musculature, the perioral muscles. In many taxa, these muscles form a robust muscular hydrostat capable of highly manipulative fine motor movements, likely accompanied by a specialized pattern of innervation. We conducted a retrograde nerve-tracing study of cranial nerve (CN) VII in pigs (Sus scrofa) to: (1) map the motor neuron pool distributions of the superior and inferior orbicularis oris, and the buccinator, to test the hypothesis that perioral muscle motor neuron pools exhibit a somatotopic organization within the facial motor nucleus; and (2) test the hypothesis that portions of the superior orbicularis oris (SOO) motor neuron pool also exhibit a somatotopic organization, reflecting a potential compartmentalization of function of the rostral, middle, and caudal segments of this muscle. Cresyl violet histological staining showed that the pig facial motor nucleus was comprised of 7 well-defined subnuclei. Neuroanatomical tracers injected into these perioral muscles transported to the motor neuron pools of the lateral 4 of the 7 subnuclei of the facial motor nucleus. The motor neuron pools of the perioral muscles were generally segregated from motoneurons innervating other facial muscles of the rostrum. However, motor neuron pools were not confined to single nuclei but instead spanned across 3-4 subnuclei. Perioral muscle motor neuron pools overlapped but were organized somatotopically. Motor neuron pools of portions of the SOO overlapped greatly with each other but exhibited a crude somatotopy within the SOO motor neuron pool. The large and somatotopically organized SOO motor neuron pool in pigs suggests that the upper lip might be more richly innervated than the other perioral muscles and functionally divided.

N2  - Comparative phylogeography has revealed remarkable patterns of concordance in the maternal phylogenies of many species. The phylogeography and historical demography of the mitochondrial control region I for 607 Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and 275 swordfish (Xiphias gladius) were analyzed to clarify the complex phylogenetic signals in the North Atlantic-Mediterranean region where they are sympatric. Atlantic bluefin tuna mtDNA is polyphyletic, and includes rare sequences sister to Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) and introgressed albacore (Thunnus alalunga) sequences. There is no geographic partitioning between Atlantic and Mediterranean samples of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Phi(ST)=0.002). In contrast, Atlantic and Mediterranean swordfish are differentiated (Phi(ST)=0.091) due to the combined effects of vicariance, secondary contact, and dissimilar regional demographic histories. Mediterranean swordfish has substantially less variation, and a more recent history (tau=2.42) than that of Atlantic swordfish (tau=7.02). In spite of the discordant phylogenetic and phylogeographic signals, the demographic history of Atlantic swordfish and Atlantic bluefin tuna (tau=7.51) suggests concordance in the timeline of population expansion. Possible scenarios of cladogenesis, expansion, and contraction, influenced by glacial cycles during the Pleistocene, are formulated.

N2  - The Streptococcus thermophilus virulent pac-type phage 2972 was isolated from a yogurt made in France in 1999. It is a representative of several phages that have emerged with the industrial use of the exopolysaccharide-producing S. thermophilus strain RD534. The genome of phage 2972 has 34,704 bp with an overall G+C content of 40.15%, making it the shortest S. thermophilus phage genome analyzed so far. Forty-four open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative proteins of 40 or more amino acids were identified, and bioinformatic analyses led to the assignment of putative functions to 23 ORFs. Comparative genomic analysis of phage 2972 with the six other sequenced S. thermophilus phage genomes confirmed that the replication module is conserved and that cos- and pac-type phages have distinct structural and packaging genes. Two group I introns were identified in the genome of 2972. They interrupted the genes coding for the putative endolysin and the terminase large subunit. Phage mRNA splicing was demonstrated for both introns, and the secondary structures were predicted. Eight structural proteins were also identified by N-terminal sequencing and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Detailed analysis of the putative minor tail proteins ORF19 and ORF21 as well as the putative receptor-binding protein ORF20 showed the following interesting features: (i) ORF19 is a hybrid protein, because it displays significant identity with both pac- and cos-type phages; (ii) ORF20 is unique; and (iii) a protein similar to ORF21 of 2972 was also found in the structure of the cos-type phage DT1, indicating that this structural protein is present in both S. thermophilus phage groups. The implications of these findings for phage classification are discussed.

N2  - The feeding kinematics of dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps) and bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus were characterized and compared incorporating the Ram-Suction Index (RSI). Mean RSI data support a suction feeding strategy for Kogia (-0.67+/-0.29; mean +/- s.d.) and a ram feeding strategy for Tursiops (0.94+/-0.11; mean +/- s.d.). Tursiops displayed two ram-based feeding behaviours: open gape approach, where gape was at least 50% of maximum in the first video field, and closed gape approach, where gape increased near food items. Four feeding phases were identified in both odontocetes: preparatory, jaw opening, gular depression and jaw closing. The mean Kogia feeding cycle duration (470+/-139 ms) was significantly shorter (P<0.003) than all Tursiops groups (pooled: 863+/-337 ms; open gape approach: 1211+/-207 ms; closed gape approach: 662+/-207 ms). Kogia mean maximum gape angle (39.8+/-18.9 degrees), mean maximum opening and closing gape angle velocities (293+/-261 deg. s(-1) and 223+/-121 deg. s(-1), respectively) were significantly greater (P<0.005) than pooled Tursiops mean maximum gape angle (24.8+/-6.6 degrees), mean maximum opening and closing gape angle velocities (84+/-56 deg. s(-1) and 120+/-54 deg. s(-1), respectively). Negative Kogia RSI values were correlated with increasing maximum gular depression and retraction, wide gape angle, and rapid opening gape angle velocity. Kinematic data support functional hypotheses that odontocetes generate suction by rapid depression of the hyoid and tongue.

N2  - An experiment, designed to simulate removal of stranded oil from a sandy beach using shoreline cleaners, was conducted at a wave-tank facility (Shoreline Environmental Research Facility [SERF]) in Corpus Christi, Texas. The experimental treatments included oiled control, oil-plus-COREXIT® 9580, and oil-plus-CytoSol®. On one end of each wave tank, a sandy beach was configured. A tidal regime was established by varying the influent flow while the effluent flow was held constant. Approximately 3 kilograms of fuel oil was systematically applied to each beach and allowed to naturally weather for 24 hours before experimental onset. Each cleaner was sprayed onto its respective beach, allowed to soak, and flushed with seawater. The flushed oil that resurfaced as a floating slick was contained at each tank center using projected air streams. Sediment, water-column, effluent, and oil slick samples were taken throughout the experimental period (∼12 hours total). Strips of previously applied tank-liner material were also analyzed for oil accumulation. Using total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) results from GC-MS analysis, a materials balance on the oil was determined for all oil treatments. It was assumed that the significant oil-accumulation "compartments" were sediments, water column, oil slick, and the tank sides. The effluent discharge from the tanks was presumed to be the primary "sink.". Under these experimental conditions, approximately half of the oil remained stranded in the beach sediments in the COREXIT® 9580-treated tank. In the CytoSol®-treated tank, approximately 20% of the oil remained in the sediment; unanticipated beach erosion was a factor in the oil removal. In the oiled-control tank, no oil remained on the beach, though this may be an experimental artifact due to beach erosion. The logistics of slick collection varied tremendously for the three slicks. Although the CytoSol® - treated slick and the oiled-control slick were comparable in volume, the treated slick was easy to collect while the control slick presented many problems. Collection of the COREXIT® - treated slick was not difficult logistically, but there was very little oil to collect.

N2  - Mobile Bay drains a watershed of 11.3×104 km2, and receives the sixth largest freshwater discharge on the North American continent. Mobile Bay has been suffering from deterioration of its water quality with increasing human impacts. Dissolved oxygen (DO) has been used as a measure of overall water quality of an aquatic system. Hypoxia (low DO) and anoxia (no DO) have been frequently observed in Mobile Bay. The complex nature of DO, being simultaneously affected by many processes including both physical and biogeochemical, provides a difficult yet challenging task for developing a comprehensive model to understand DO dynamics. Understanding the variations in DO in a water body would require simultaneous consideration of all the causing processes. What make the situation even more complex are the different spatial and time scales at which the causing processes act and the non-linearity of the causing processes. Such dynamic variations of DO merit a modeling system with multi-scale features, which should be able to capture the contributions from various causing processes with different time scales. Wavelets are a framework of multi-scale basis function that can transform a time-series data into its components with different time scales, with each scale associated with a different frequency. In this research, a wavelet-based model is developed to describe quantitative cause-effect relationships between the physical processes and DO with less refined consideration of biogeochemical processes. In tests with data collected from Mobile Bay, the proposed model provides an effective method for representing causes of the variations in DO.

N2  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The impact of process conditions and crystal properties on the structure of thermal oxides formed on AlN were determined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Oxidation for 2 hours at both 800 ° and 1000 °C produced mostly amorphous oxide layers whereas oxidation for 4 and 6 hours at 1000 °C produced partly crystalline and epitaxial oxide layers. The crystalline oxide was mostly single phase á-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> except at the surface where it was a mixture of γ-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and á-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. The amorphous oxide layer first transformed to γ-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and then to the stable á-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> as evidenced by the non-uniform thickness of the oxide and the existence of the γ-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> at the surface. The AlN crystal contained a high density of defects at the interface at 800 °C but it was nearly defect- and oxygen-free at 1000 °C. This could be due to the rapid diffusion of the nitrogen and aluminum interstitials at high temperatures leading to a point defect equilibrium throughout the nitride. A faceted interface between Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and AlN could be attributed to non-uniform out diffusion of aluminum.</jats:p>

N2  - The goal of this study was to determine the distribution of citrate synthase (CS), beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HOAD), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and myoglobin (Mb) concentration in the locomotor muscles (epaxial muscles) and heart of harbor seals. The entire epaxial musculature, which produces most of the power for submerged swimming, was removed and weighed, and three transverse sections (cranial, middle, and caudal) were taken along the muscle bundle. Multiple samples were taken along points on a circular grid using a 6-mm biopsy. A single sample was taken from the left ventricle of the heart. Muscle groups of similar function were taken from three dogs as a control. Mean values were calculated for four roughly equal quadrants in each transverse section of the epaxial muscles. There were no significant differences among the quadrants within any of the transverse sections for the three enzymes or Mb. However, there were significant differences in the mean enzyme activities and Mb concentrations along the length of the muscle. The middle and caudal sections had significantly higher mean levels of CS, LDH, and Mb than the cranial section, which may be correlated with power production during swimming. The enzyme ratios CS/HOAD and LDH/CS exhibited no variation within transverse sections or along the length of the epaxial muscles. Relative to the dog, the epaxial muscles and heart of the harbor seal had higher HOAD levels and lower CS/HOAD, which, taken together, indicate an increased capacity for aerobic lipid metabolism during diving.

N2  - Palolo worms (Palola, Eunicidae) are best known for their annual mass spawnings, or "risings," in the South Pacific. Palola currently contains 14 morphologically similar species, mostly from shallow tropical waters. In this study, 60 specimens of Palola from nine locations in the tropical North Pacific and the Caribbean were sequenced for the two mitochondrial markers cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S ribosomal RNA to infer phylogenetic relationships, genetic diversity, and phylogeography within the taxon. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Bayesian statistics and parsimony. Vouchers of the same specimens were examined morphologically. Two major clades (A and B) can be distinguished within the monophyletic Palola. A number of individuals in clade B bear rows of ventral eyespots in the posterior body region, typical for swarming P. viridis and probably a synapomorphy for clade B. No morphological synapomorphy was found for clade A. Haplotypes from divergent clades often co-occur in the same location. Some haplotypes are geographically widespread, in one case covering the entire east-west expansion of the tropical Pacific. These results imply that despite the apparent absence of teleplanic larvae in eunicid polychaetes, long-distance dispersal is possible in at least some lineages of Palola. With the first taste of palolo I understood the Samoans' love for it. Certainly it suggested a salty caviar, but with something added, a strong, rich whiff of the mystery and fecundity of the ocean depths. -R. Steinberg. Pacific and Southeast Asian cooking.

N2  - <jats:p> Although the components of plan quality are well defined, little empirical research has been conducted to understand the degree to which policies are being implemented after plan adoption and the factors contributing to the variation in plan implementation. The authors test the efficacy of land-use planning and plan implementation in Florida by measuring the degree to which wetland development over a ten-year period conforms to the original design of adopted comprehensive plans. First, they spatially identify concentrated areas of wetland alteration permits and compare these locations with the adopted future land-use maps for county and city jurisdictions in the southern portion of the state. Second, they examine the major factors influencing nonconforming development patterns across the study area. Results indicate a well-defined spatial pattern of nonconforming wetland development and isolate specific socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic variables impacting these deviations from the original spatial intent of local plans. </jats:p>

The authors systematically evaluate the comprehensive plans of fortysix local jurisdictions in southern Florida for the presence of five sprawl-reduction planning policies (SRPPs) using planevaluation techniques. Results indicate a clear statistical and spatial pattern of SRPPs across the study area and show that specific socioeconomic and demographic characteristics influence the adoption of SRPPs in comprehensive plans. </jats:p>

N2  - Tens of thousands of man-made chemicals are in regular use and discharged into the environment. Many of them are known to interfere with the hormonal systems in humans and wildlife. Given the complexity of endocrine systems, there are many ways in which endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can affect the body's signaling system, and this makes unraveling the mechanisms of action of these chemicals difficult. A major concern is that some of these EDCs appear to be biologically active at extremely low concentrations. There is growing evidence to indicate that the guiding principle of traditional toxicology that "the dose makes the poison" may not always be the case because some EDCs do not induce the classical dose-response relationships. The European Union project COMPRENDO (Comparative Research on Endocrine Disrupters--Phylogenetic Approach and Common Principles focussing on Androgenic/Antiandrogenic Compounds) therefore aims to develop an understanding of potential health problems posed by androgenic and antiandrogenic compounds (AACs) to wildlife and humans by focusing on the commonalities and differences in responses to AACs across the animal kingdom (from invertebrates to vertebrates) .

N2  - In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in how growth hormone (GH) transgenesis affects fish physiology. However, the results of these studies are often difficult to interpret because the transgenic and non-transgenic fish had very different environmental/rearing histories. This study used a stable line of size-matched GH Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were reared in a shared tank with controls (at 10 degrees C, for approximately 9 months) to perform a comprehensive examination of the cardiorespiratory physiology of GH transgenic salmon, and serves as a novel test of the theory of symmorphosis. The GH transgenic salmon had a 3.6x faster growth rate, and 21 and 25% higher values for mass-specific routine and standard oxygen consumption (M(O(2))), respectively. However, there was no concurrent increase in their maximum M(O(2)), which resulted in them having an 18% lower metabolic scope and a 9% reduction in critical swimming speed. This decreased metabolic capacity/performance was surprising given that the transgenics had a 29% larger heart with an 18% greater mass-specific maximum in situ cardiac output, a 14% greater post-stress blood haemoglobin concentration, 5-10% higher red muscle and heart aerobic enzyme (citrate synthase or cytochrome oxidase) activities, and twofold higher resting and 1.7x higher post-stress, catecholamine levels. However, gill surface area was the only cardiorespiratory parameter that was not enhanced, and our data suggest that gill oxygen transfer may have been limiting. Overall, this research: (1) shows that there are significant metabolic costs associated with GH transgenesis in this line of Atlantic salmon; (2) provides the first direct evidence that cardiac function is enhanced by GH transgenesis; (3) shows that a universal upregulation of post-smolt (adult) GH transgenic salmon cardiorespiratory physiology, as suggested by symmorphosis, does not occur; and (4) supports the idea that whereas differences in arterial oxygen transport (i.e. cardiac output and blood oxygen carrying capacity) are important determinants of inter-specific differences in aerobicity, diffusion-limited processes must be enhanced to achieve substantial intra-specific improvements in metabolic and swimming performance.

N2  - The lower limits of photosynthetically useable radiation at which growth and photosynthesis can occur establish the lower boundaries for the extent of photolithotrophy in the biosphere. Photolithotrophic growth denotes the capacity to grow with photons as the sole energy input. Slippage in terms of photosynthetic energy conversion implies a less than theoretical stoichiometry of energy-transduction process(es) such as the dissipation of intermediates of O(2) evolution and of ATP synthesis (H(+)/e(-) and H(+)/ATP ratios). Slippage is particularly important in limiting the growth of photolithotrophic organisms at very low photon fluence rates. We found that Dunaliella tertiolecta and Phaeodactylum tricornutum avoid such reductions in photon use efficiency by increasing the size and number of their photosynthetic units, respectively, and by altering Q(A) reduction kinetics on the reducing side of PS II. P. tricornutum is also less susceptible to slippage in terms of the breakdown of intermediates in its O(2) evolution pathway than D. tertiolecta. Minimizing H(+) leakage through the CF(0)-CF(1) ATP synthetase (and other H(+ )porters) is also discussed briefly. In combination, strategies employed by P. tricornutum effectively allow it to grow and photosynthesize at lower rates of energy input than D. tertiolecta, consistent with our observations. Differences in the responses of the photosynthetic apparatus of these two marine microalgae are mechanistic and probably representative of evolutionary divergences associated with strategies for dealing with environmental perturbations.

N2  - The thermal oxidation of aluminum nitride was developed as a means to study defects in bulk aluminum nitride crystals. The oxidation kinetics was established for the dry oxidation of highly textured AlN polycrystals produced by sublimation-recombination crystal growth in a tungsten furnace. Despite seeding on polycrystalline tungsten, the grains were predominantly [0001] oriented as verified by electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD). The oxidation rate is dependent on the crystal's orientation, polarity, stress, and surface condition, thus oxidation decorates grain boundaries, polishing scratches, and inversion domains by producing oxide layers of different thicknesses. Low temperature (800°C) dry oxidation produced an amorphous oxide layer and generated a high density of defects (vacancies, stacking faults, and dislocations) in the nitride near the oxide/nitride interface, as observed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. In contrast, high temperature oxidation (1000°C) produced a crystalline oxide layer, and left the nitride free of observable defects. © 2006 Materials Research Society.

N2  - <jats:p>Since the description of the Bahamian cave-fish Lucifuga spelaeotes Cohen &amp; Robins, 1970, which was based on two specimens from New Providence Island, the species has been observed and/ or collected several times in marine blue-holes and inland caves on various Bahamian Islands. Hitherto, all Lucifuga records from the Bahamas have been referred to L. spelaeotes, but examination of 50 specimens (42–166 mm SL) collected at 7 different islands showed that two species are represented in the Bahamas: 44 specimens from Berry, New Providence, Eleuthera, Great Exuma and Long Island belong to L. spelaeotes, whereas 6 specimens from Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands are referable to L. lucayana, new species. The new species is here described and compared to the material of L. spelaeotes, which includes specimens from several hitherto unpublished locations. The two species are well separated from the Cuban species in number of caudal finrays (10 vs. 8), size of eye (0.7–1.8 vs. 0.0–0.3 % SL) and number of vertebrae (50–55 vs. 45–48). The Bahamian species differ from each other mainly in head squamation, palatine dentition, number of finrays and pigmentation of the three elongated gill-rakers. Lucifuga lucayana is geographically separated from L. spelaeotes by the deep waters of the Northeast and Northwest Providence Channels.</jats:p>

N2  - Persistent organic pollutants, POPs (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls) can seriously and deleteriously affect environmental quality and human health. These organic pollutants are exhibiting high affinities to solid phases and thus, quickly end up in sediments. To better understand the role of carbonaceous materials in the transport and distributions of POPs in terrestrial and near-shore environments, concentrations of PCBs and carbonaceous materials (including total organic carbon, black carbon and total carbohydrates), were determined in surface sediments of the Danshui River and nearby coastal areas, Taiwan. Total concentrations of PCBs in the sediments ranged from non-detectable to 83.9 ngg(-1), dry weight, with the maximum value detected near the discharge point of the marine outfall from the Pali Sewage Treatment Plant. These results suggest that the sewage treatment plant has discharged PCBs in the past and the concentrations are still high due to their persistence; alternatively, PCBs are still being discharged in the estuarine and near-shore environment of the Danshui River. Organic carbon and black carbon concentrations correlated well with those of total PCBs in the sediments, suggesting that both organic carbon and black carbon significantly affect the distribution of trace organic pollutants through either post-depositional adsorption, or by co-transport of similar source materials. The field results demonstrate that black carbon and plays an important role in the general distribution of PCBs, while concentrations of some specific PCBs are affected by both black carbon and organic carbon concentrations.

N2  - <jats:p> Based on optimality models, lekking males holding higher quality territories should spend more effort on territory maintenance and less effort on body maintenance. We tested the hypothesis that benefits are correlated with costs for male sea otters, Enhydra lutris (L., 1758). Activity state was recorded during focal follows of 10 individuals (n = 127). Higher quality territories had larger area, more food resources attractive to females, a higher ratio of protective shoreline edge, and higher accessibility for females evading male harassment. Contrary to our prediction, territory quality was uncorrelated with measures of cost: territory maintenance (patrolling, interacting) and body maintenance (feeding, grooming). We rejected the hypothesis that proximate benefits would be correlated with costs and suggested the following alternative working hypotheses: (i) given the high metabolic rate of sea otters, male breeding success may depend as much on maintaining body condition as maintaining a territory; (ii) higher quality territories with shoreline edge may not require additional patrolling effort; (iii) males may not expend extra effort in territory maintenance until more females come into estrus; or (iv) our seasonal measures of the benefits and costs of territoriality may not have accurately reflected factors influencing the switch between territorial and non-territorial tactics. </jats:p>

N2  - One physiological adaptation for prolonged dive duration in marine mammals is an elevated myoglobin (Mb) concentration in skeletal muscle. To determine the influence of Mb concentration on the aerobic dive limit (ADL), we modified a previously published model that simulated aerobic dives in a Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) and ran it for four Mb concentrations: 5, 27, 54 and 108 g Mb kg(-1) muscle representing 7%, 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively, of the normal Mb concentration in Weddell seal skeletal muscle. The model was run at increasing levels of muscular exertion and under postabsorptive and postprandial conditions to determine their effect on ADL. For each set of conditions, the model was also run at different levels of cardiac output (i.e. the dive response was varied) to determine the level of convective oxygen transport that optimized the ADL. In a postabsorptive state at a routine level of muscular exertion for a diving Weddell seal, a decrease in Mb concentration to 7% of normal caused a 39% decrease in the ADL (18 min to 11 min), while doubling the Mb concentration increased the ADL by 30% (18 min to 24 min). Under postprandial conditions at a routine level of muscular exertion, doubling the Mb concentration did not increase the ADL (12 min). The convective oxygen transport needed to meet the metabolic demands (Heat Increment of Feeding, HIF) of the splanchnic organs during digestion and assimilation required a cardiac output that was not optimal for the efficient use of muscle oxygen stores. This resulted in an over perfusion of the muscles and incomplete use of myoglobin-bound oxygen. As a result, the postprandial ADL was limited by the amount of oxygen stored in the blood, and increasing the Mb concentration had no effect on the ADL. We hypothesize that myoglobin concentration is optimized for the type and duration of dives routinely made by Weddell seals, and that a further increase may not increase the ADL for most free-ranging dives.

N2  - The intra-phyletic relationships of sipunculan worms were analyzed based on DNA sequence data from four gene regions and 58 morphological characters. Initially we analyzed the data under direct optimization using parsimony as optimality criterion. An implied alignment resulting from the direct optimization analysis was subsequently utilized to perform a Bayesian analysis with mixed models for the different data partitions. For this we applied a doublet model for the stem regions of the 18S rRNA. Both analyses support monophyly of Sipuncula and most of the same clades within the phylum. The analyses differ with respect to the relationships among the major groups but whereas the deep nodes in the direct optimization analysis generally show low jackknife support, they are supported by 100% posterior probability in the Bayesian analysis. Direct optimization has been useful for handling sequences of unequal length and generating conservative phylogenetic hypotheses whereas the Bayesian analysis under mixed models provided high resolution in the basal nodes of the tree.

Environmental Context. Trace metals are both micronutrients and toxicants, depending on concentration, and in coastal waters they bind to natural organic matter including nanoparticles. The binding type affects trace metal bioavailability to bivalves such as oysters, which ingest metals through water and food particles. Bivalves are biomonitors because of the high trace metal concentrations, especially Cu and Zn, in their tissues. Here, the polysaccharide alginic acid is shown to protect against the assimilation and bioavailability of trace metals to American oysters.
Abstract. Little is known about how colloidal macromolecular organic matter (COM) modifies the bioavailability of toxic metals to aquatic organisms. In order to understand the physical and chemical properties of COM on the bioavailability of some metals to estuarine bivalves used as biomonitors, American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were exposed to natural COMs and model acid polysaccharides (APS, alginic acid (AA), kappa carrageenan (CAR), and latex particles), and natural colloidal organic carbon (COC), tagged with either radioactive Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Fe, Hg or Zn, or 14C-labelled sugar OH groups. Filter-feeding oysters efficiently removed latex particles 0.04 µm in diameter, with removal half-times of 2.5–5.5 h, equivalent to a filtration rate of approximately 3 L day–1 g–1. Thus, AA protects against metal uptake by oysters, which is confirmed by metal dry-weight concentration factors (DCFs) similar to, or lower than, those for 14C-labelled AA. However, metal-DCFs for CAR and COC were higher than for 14C-labelled counterparts, suggesting that in these treatments, metal uptake was enhanced over that of carbon. The 14C-labelled AA was taken up significantly more than other 14C-labelled organics, suggesting different behavior in the digestive tract. Bioavailabilty of metals bound to organic nanoparticles with different nutritional and physiological properties is not fully understood, and will require further experiments.

N2  - Th(IV) isotopes are important proxies in oceanographic investigations, and are used as tracers of particle dynamics and particulate organic matter (POC) fluxes out of the euphotic zone through the use of 234Th/POC ratios. These approaches rely on empirically determined and variable POC to 234Th ratios, which might be controlled, in parts, by the abundance of exopolymeric substances (EPS). EPS contain acidic polysaccharides (APS) and are excreted by both phytoplankton and bacteria. To this end, radiotracer experiments with EPS from microbial cultures were conducted to determine the binding environment of 234Th(IV)-binding ligands in colloids and suspended particles in marine systems. In these experiments, the 234Th distribution during isoelectric focusing (IEF) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was related to the functional group composition of EPS and of colloidal organic matter (COM) isolated from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) using cross-flow ultrafiltration. EPS was extracted from phytoplankton (Emiliania huxleyi and Synechococcus elongatus) and bacteria (Sagittula stellata and Roseobacter gallaeciensis) cultures by repeated alcohol precipitation. Phosphate and sulfate concentrations were determined using ion chromatography (IC). IEF profiles indicated that 49% to 65% of the 234Th-labeled EPS from plankton and bacteria as well as COM samples from the GOM was found concentrated below pH of 4, near an isoelectric point, pHIEP, of about 2. The carboxylic acid maxima for extracted EPS and COM samples appeared close to the pHIEF of 234Th(IV). The phosphate maximum appeared at the same pHIEF as 234Th(IV) for EPS from R. gallaeciensis and S. elongatus. The sulfate maximum was found at the same pHIEF as 234Th(IV) for EPS from S. elongatus and COM. The molecular weight (MW) of the strongly Th(IV)-binding ligand varied from 1 to 14 kDa, depending on the species, but was about 10 kDa in COM. Thus, depending on the species of plankton or bacteria, the MW and specific functional group composition of the strongly 234Th(IV)-binding amphiphilic biomolecule can vary. Therefore, different acidic functional groups can, at times, contribute to the binding of Th(IV) to the EPS chelating ligand, which can also have different MWs. This implies that the binding environment for Th(IV), which is present at total concentrations at least a million times lower than the acid functional groups, consists of strong polydentate chelate complexes in clustered structures of carboxylate, sulfates and/or phosphates. The combination of strongly chelating groups and amphiphilicity gives this biomolecule the unique properties of a "sticky" ligand. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - For fish to survive large acute temperature increases (i.e. >10.0 degrees C) that may bring them close to their critical thermal maximum (CTM), oxygen uptake at the gills and distribution by the cardiovascular system must increase to match tissue oxygen demand. To examine the effects of an acute temperature increase ( approximately 1.7 degrees C h(-1) to CTM) on the cardiorespiratory physiology of Atlantic cod, we (1) carried out respirometry on 10.0 degrees C acclimated fish, while simultaneously measuring in vivo cardiac parameters using Transonic probes, and (2) constructed in vitro oxygen binding curves on whole blood from 7.0 degrees C acclimated cod at a range of temperatures. Both cardiac output (Q) and heart rate (fh) increased until near the fish's CTM (22.2+/-0.2 degrees C), and then declined rapidly. Q(10) values for Q and fh were 2.48 and 2.12, respectively, and increases in both parameters were tightly correlated with O(2) consumption. The haemoglobin (Hb)-oxygen binding curve at 24.0 degrees C showed pronounced downward and rightward shifts compared to 20.0 degrees C and 7.0 degrees C, indicating that both binding capacity and affinity decreased. Further, Hb levels were lower at 24.0 degrees C than at 20.0 degrees C and 7.0 degrees C. This was likely to be due to cell swelling, as electrophoresis of Hb samples did not suggest protein denaturation, and at 24.0 degrees C Hb samples showed peak absorbance at the expected wavelength (540 nm). Our results show that cardiac function is unlikely to limit metabolic rate in Atlantic cod from Newfoundland until close to their CTM, and we suggest that decreased blood oxygen binding capacity may contribute to the plateau in oxygen consumption.

N2  - Recent interest in expanding offshore oil production within waters of the United States has been met with opposition by groups concerned with recreational, environmental, and aesthetic values associated with the coastal zone. Although the proposition of new oil platforms off the coast has generated conflict over how coastal resources should be utilized, little research has been conducted on where these user conflicts might be most intense and which sites might be most suitable for locating oil production facilities in light of the multiple, and often times, competing interests. In this article, we develop a multiple-criteria spatial decision support tool that identifies the potential degree of conflict associated with oil and gas production activities for existing lease tracts in the coastal margin of Texas. We use geographic information systems to measure and map a range of potentially competing representative values impacted by establishing energy extraction infrastructure and then spatially identify which leased tracts are the least contentious sites for oil and gas production in Texas state waters. Visual and statistical results indicate that oil and gas lease blocks within the study area vary in their potential to generate conflict among multiple stakeholders.

N2  - The capacity of epifauna to control algal proliferation following nutrient input depends on responses of both grazers and upper trophic level consumers to enrichment. We examined the responses of Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) epifaunal assemblages to nutrient enrichment at two sites in Florida Bay with varying levels of phosphorus limitation. We compared epifaunal density, biomass, and species diversity in 2 m2 plots that had either ambient nutrient concentrations or had been enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus for 6 months. At the severely P-limited site, total epifaunal density and biomass were two times higher in enriched than in unenriched plots. Caridean shrimp, grazing isopods, and gammarid amphipods accounted for much of the increase in density; brachyuran crabs, primary predatory fish, and detritivorous sea cucumbers accounted for most of the increase in biomass. At the less P-limited site, total epifaunal density and biomass were not affected by nutrient addition, although there were more caridean shrimp and higher brachyuran crab and pink shrimp biomass in enriched plots. At both sites, some variation in epifaunal density and biomass was explained by features of the macrophyte canopy, such as T. testudinum and Halodule wrightii percent cover, suggesting that enrichment may change the refuge value of the macrophyte canopy for epifauna. Additional variation in epifaunal density and biomass was explained by epiphyte pigment concentrations, suggesting that enrichment may change the microalgal food resources that support grazing epifauna. Increased epifaunal density in enriched plots suggests that grazers may be able to control epiphytic algal proliferation following moderate nutrient input to Florida Bay. © Springer 2006.

N2  - DNA sequence polymorphisms contained in intron 6 of the lactate dehydrogenase-A (ldh-A) gene were used to examine the genetic population structure of Pacific swordfish (Xiphias gladius Linnaeus, 1758). Seven alleles defined by five polymorphic sites were identified among 305 swordfish. Comparisons of allele frequency were conducted for 11 samples, including Chile (multiple years), Ecuador (multiple years), Mexico, Hawaii (multiple years), eastern Australia, and western Australia. Although there was evidence of genic differentiation, global differentiation was low (Fst= 0.001). To increase the power of the tests of differentiation, samples within each region were pooled into four regional samples. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed, and the global fixation index increased more than ten-fold (Fst= 0.013). Global exact tests of genic and genotypic differentiation were significant, and so were the pair-wise comparisons between the south-eastern Pacific Ocean (SEPO) sample from Chile, and all other regions. In addition, the north-eastern Pacific Ocean (NEPO; Ecuador to Mexico) was different from the north-central Pacific Ocean (NCPO; Hawaii), which in turn was different from the south-western Pacific Ocean (SWPO; pooled eastern and western Australia). These results may have important implications for the fishery management of Pacific swordfish, particularly because of the heterogeneity observed between SEPO and NEPO. © 2006 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.

N2  - Sedimentary material from coastal and nearshore areas in the Mississippi Delta region are comprised of different organic carbon sources with diverse ages that require isotopic and elemental records for resolving the various sources of plant residues. Carbon isotopic ((13)C, (14)C) values were used to differentiate contributions from plants using the C3, C4, and/or CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) carbon fixation pathways., and iodine concentrations indicated that wetland plant residues are a significant source of organic carbon in a sediment core from the Mississippi River delta region collected at a 60 m water depth. This sediment core had been extensively described in Oktay et al. [Oktay, S.D., Santschi, P.H., Moran, J.E., Sharma, P., 2000. The (129)Iodine Bomb Pulse Recorded in Mississippi River delta Sediments: Results from Isotopes of I, Pu, Cs, Pb, and C. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 64 (6), 989-996.] and significantly, includes unique features that had not previously been seen in the marine environment. These special features include a plutonium isotopic close-in fallout record that indicates a purely terrestrial source for these sediment particles and the elements associated with it, and a distinct iodine isotopic peak (as well as peaks for plutonium and cesium isotopes) that indicate little bioturbation in this core. Our carbon isotopic and iodine data can thus be compared to published records of changes in drainage basin land use, river hydrology, and hydrodynamic sorting of suspended particles to elucidate if these changes are reflected in nearshore sediments. This comparison suggests a significant contribution for organic carbon (OC) from C4 plants to these sediments during the 1950's to early 1960's. Relative older carbon isotopes, and episodically high iodine concentrations (up to 34 ppm) were observed during this time period that (1) indicate sediment deposition that is coincident with the times of major hydrological changes induced from dam and levee building in both the upper and lower reaches of the Mississippi River drainage basin, and (2) suggest episodic organic carbon deposition from wetland plant residues.

N2  - A high-resolution elemental, isotopic, and molecular record of organic matter was established for the uppermost sediments of Hole 1229E (0-700 cm below seafloor), drilled during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 201 on the Peruvian margin. Diagnostic parameters of organic matter (OM) such as the atomic C org over total nitrogen ratio (C/N), the organic carbon isotopic signatures (δ 13 C org ), and lignin-derived biomarker concentrations (∑8) all suggest that terrigenous OM influx was more important during glacial than interglacial periods on the Peruvian shelf. In contrast to other shelf environments, however, fluctuations in lignin ratios ([Ad/Al]v, S/V, and C/V) across the Pleistocene-Holocene transition point to shifting composition in terrigenous OM sources from coarse and undegraded woody materials during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to much more altered and finer soft tissue materials during the Holocene. In addition, the total OM content preserved in the Peruvian shelf sediments was lower during the LGM. This observation is in agreement with prior work in the region and may be explained by a migration of the upwelling cells toward deeper sections of the shelf during glacial lower sea level stances. The potential decrease in upwelling strength at ODP Site 1229 and other similar shallow sites of the region may thus have been responsible for lower water column productivity and decreased preservation potential (decrease in oxygen minimum conditions) of settling organic matter. Finally, during the Holocene, the shifts in C org concentrations, (C/N) ratios, and δ 13 C org signatures are not entirely controlled by terrigenous OM inputs in this system. Apparent terrigenous signatures during that period seem to be derived from diagenetic processes in addition to potential source changes.

N2  - The impact of process conditions on the structure of thermal oxides formed on AlN was determined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Oxidation for 2 hours at 800 °C produced mostly amorphous oxide layers whereas oxidation for 6 hours at 1000 °C produced partly crystalline and epitaxial oxide layers. The crystalline oxide was mostly single phase α-Al2O3except at the surface where it was a mixture of γ-Al2O3and α-Al2O3. Prior to oxidation AlN crystal was almost free of defects. The AlN contained a high density of defects, and measurable amounts of oxygen and nitrogen near the interface when oxidized at 800 °C but it was nearly defect-free, and nitrogen- and oxygen-free for oxidation at 1000 °C. This could be due to the rapid out diffusion of nitrogen and oxygen at higher temperature leading to equilibrium throughout the sample. © 2007 Materials Research Society.

N2  - Recent studies have shown that harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) have an increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume density that may be an adaptation for maintaining aerobic metabolism during diving. However, these studies were based on single samples taken from locomotory muscles. In this study, we took multiple samples from a transverse section of the epaxial (primary locomotory) muscles and single samples from the m. pectoralis (secondary locomotory) muscle of five wild harbor seals. Average mitochondrial volume density of the epaxial muscles was 5.6%, which was 36.6% higher than predicted for a terrestrial mammal of similar mass, and most (82.1%) of the mitochondria were interfibrillar, unlike athletic terrestrial mammals. In the epaxial muscles, the total mitochondrial volume density was significantly greater in samples collected from the deep (6.0%) compared with superficial (5.0%) regions. Volume density of mitochondria in the pectoralis muscle was similar (5.2%) to that of the epaxial muscles. Taken together, these adaptations reduce the intracellular distance between mitochondria and oxymyoglobin and increase the mitochondrial diffusion surface area. This, in combination with elevated myoglobin concentrations, potentially increases the rate of oxygen diffusion into mitochondria and prevents diffusion limitation so that aerobic metabolism can be maintained under low oxygen partial pressure that develops during diving.

N2  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the present study, the type and densities of defects in AlN crystals grown on 6H-SiC seeds by the sublimation-recombination method were assessed. The positions of the defects in AlN were first identified by defect selective etching (DSE) in molten NaOH-KOH at 400 °C for 2 minutes. Etching produced pits of three different sizes: 1.77 ìm, 2.35 ìm , and 2.86 ìm. The etch pits were either aligned together forming a sub-grain boundary or randomly distributed. The smaller etch pits were either isolated or associated with larger etch pits. After preparing cross-sections of the pits by the focused ion beam (FIB) technique, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to determine which dislocation type (edge, mixed or screw) produced a specific etch pit sizes. Preliminary TEM bright field and dark field study using different zone axes and diffraction vectors indicates an edge dislocation with a Burgers vector 1/3 is associated with the smallest etch pit size.</jats:p>

N2  - Soot black carbon (here expressed as GBC) is present in sediments of Central Park and Prospect Park Lakes, New York City (NYC), and peaks in the middle of the 20th Century at the highest values (1-3% dry weight) ever reported in urban lakes. During that period (approximately 1940-1970), the GBC represents up to 28% of the total organic carbon (OC). Radionuclide-normalized whole core inventories of accumulated GBC are similar in the two lakes which are separated by approximately 15 km, suggesting that emissions of fine soot particles may have accumulated homogeneously over at least the urban center of NYC. The distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sediments is decoupled from that of GBC. The highest levels of total PAHs correspond to peak coal use for space heating in NYC in the early 1900s. In contrast, GBC concentrations were highest in the mid 1900s, a period when oil combustion dominated local fossil fuel use and incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) was common practice in NYC. Decreases in GBC levels observed in more recently deposited sediments are consistent with improvements in particle emissions control systems. Non-soot BC (char) was identified by a high carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio that persisted after correction for GBC. This likely tracer of MSW incineration was estimated to contribute an additional '35% of total organic carbon found in the sediments deposited during the peak period of combustion. The temporal trends of soot-BC observed in our lake cores do not agree with published historical reconstructions based on fuel consumption and estimated emission factors.

N2  - <jats:p>Assessment and continuous improvement are essential and critical processes for higher education. Development and implementation of such processes are not only required by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) as part of the accreditation process but are also necessary for the maturation and development of any engineering technology program. The assessment and continuous improvement plan discussed here was developed at Old Dominion University (ODU) and implemented during the last accreditation cycle within the Engineering Technology Department. The plan is based on two cycles of assessment and evaluation, a short cycle of one year and a long term cycle of three years. The plan includes a variety of assessment methods and tools. In addition to assessing the achievement of program outcomes, the plan allows assessment of program objectives and goals. A method for individual course assessment is also presented. Issues related to institutionalization of the assessment process are also discussed.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Total mercury (Hg) concentration was determined in the tissues of 10 pelagic fishes in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and dietary tracers (stable isotopes and fatty acids) were used to evaluate the relationship between Hg and feeding history. Highest Hg levels were observed in blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), carcharhinid sharks (Carcha rhinus spp.), and little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), ranging from 1.08 to 10.52 ppm. Moderate to low concentrations (&lt;1.0 ppm) were observed in blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphinfish (Cory phaena hippurus), greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), wahoo (Acantho cybium solandri), and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). For the majority of species examined, Hg concentrations did not vary significantly between location (Texas vs. Louisiana) or collection period (2002 and 2003). Significant positive relationships between Hg concentration and body size and (or) weight were detected for 6 of the 10 taxa examined. Hg concentration was also positively associated with trophic position. Three natural associations were identified using stable isotope and fatty acid signatures. Still, no connection between these natural trophic associations and Hg concentration was observed, suggesting that Hg concentration in pelagic fishes was more closely linked to trophic position and size than feeding history.</jats:p>

N2  - During diving explorations of anchialine cave systems on Abaco Island, Bahamas, we collected five larvae that represent different developmental stages of remipede crustaceans. Based on four early naupliar stages and a post-naupliar larva, it is possible for the first time to reconstruct the postembryonic development of Remipedia some 25 years after their discovery. These specimens begin to fill in some critical gaps in our knowledge of this important group of crustaceans.

N2  - In order to understand the fate of pesticides in marine environments, concentrations of pesticides and different carbonaceous fractions were determined for surface sediments in the Danshui River and nearby coastal areas of Taiwan. The major compounds detected were tetrachlorobenzene, HCHs, chlordane, aldrin, DDDs, DDEs and DDTs. Total concentrations of pesticides in the sediments ranged from not detectable to 23 ng g(-1), with the maximum value detected near the discharge point of the marine outfall from the Pali sewage treatment plant. These results confirm that pesticides persist in estuarine and nearby coastal environments of the Danshui River well after their ban. Concentrations of total pesticides significantly correlate with concentrations of total organic carbon and black carbon in these sediments, suggesting that total organic carbon and black carbon regulate the distribution of trace organic pollutants in fluvial and coastal marine sediments.

N2  - Prymnesium parvum is a harmful alga whose blooms can cause fish kills in brackish waters. Two potential suppressants of this alga were tested, ammonium and barley straw extract (BSE), at temperatures of 10, 20 and 30 degrees C. Laboratory batch cultures were grown for 3 weeks at each temperature, with weekly doses of ammonium or BSE at either low or high levels, or a no-dose control treatment. The growth rate of P. parvum during exponential phase was highest at 20 degrees C and lowest at 10 degrees C, and was stimulated by the highest ammonium dose. Only cultures grown at 20 degrees C were toxic to fish. The highest ammonium dose abolished such toxicity and reduced the endpoint population density of P. parvum. BSE did not reduce the exponential growth rate, endpoint density, or toxicity to fish of P. parvum. The results support the use of ammonium additions, but not BSE, to suppress harmful blooms of P. parvum in those circumstances where the possible disadvantages can be managed.

N2  - The function of the hyolingual complex in three odontocete species was investigated to compare adaptations of divergent feeding strategies, suction and ram feeding. Pygmy and dwarf sperm whales, members of the genus Kogia (or kogiids), are known to be strong suction feeders. We tested the hypotheses that kogiids would have a larger, more robust hyolingual complex, and that hyolingual muscles would have a greater maximum theoretical muscle tension compared with ram-based feeders such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). A robustness index and surface area was calculated for bony hyoid elements in kogiids and bottlenose dolphins. The anatomy, muscle architecture, pinnation, two-dimensional angle of attachment and maximum theoretical muscle tension were measured in each hyolingual muscle. A functional model incorporating vector analyses of hyolingual musculature was created for kogiids and bottlenose dolphins to assess differences in function of their hyolingual complexes. Kogiid hyoid surface areas were significantly greater (P = 0.01) than in bottlenose dolphins. Most maximum theoretical muscle tensions of hyolingual complexes were not significantly different within or between species. The data suggest that associated orofacial and tongue morphology, particularly the relationship of hyoid shape and tongue retractor muscles, greatly influences suction capability in odontocetes. Kogiids demonstrated adaptations that occlude lateral gape, including a novel vertical ridge on each side of the mandible, and a shortened mandible that is capable of a large gape, and gape angle. These adaptations presumably assist in maintaining negative intraoral pressure generated by the depression and retraction of the relatively short and wide kogiid tongue. The tongues of kogiids should be capable of generating greater intraoral volume changes compared with the long, narrow tongue of bottlenose dolphins.

N2  - Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) possess modified vibrissae that are used in conjunction with specialized perioral musculature to manipulate vegetation for ingestion, and aid in the tactile exploration of their environment. Therefore it is expected that manatees possess a large facial motor nucleus that exhibits a complex organization relative to other taxa. The topographical organization of the facial motor nucleus of five adult Florida manatees was analyzed using neuroanatomical methods. Cresyl violet and hematoxylin staining were used to localize the rostrocaudal extent of the facial motor nucleus as well as the organization and location of subdivisions within this nucleus. Differences in size, length, and organization of the facial motor nucleus among mammals correspond to the functional importance of the superficial facial muscles, including perioral musculature involved in the movement of mystacial vibrissae. The facial motor nucleus of Florida manatees was divided into seven subnuclei. The mean rostrocaudal length, width, and height of the entire Florida manatee facial motor nucleus was 6.6 mm (SD 8 0.51; range: 6.2-7.5 mm), 4.7 mm (SD 8 0.65; range: 4.0-5.6 mm), and 3.9 mm (SD 8 0.26; range: 3.5-4.2 mm), respectively. It is speculated that manatees could possess direct descending corticomotorneuron projections to the facial motornucleus. This conjecture is based on recent data for rodents, similiarities in the rodent and sirenian muscular-vibrissal complex, and the analogous nature of the sirenian cortical Rindenkerne system with the rodent barrel system.

N2  - Homologous recombination between circular sister chromosomes during DNA replication in bacteria can generate chromosome dimers that must be resolved into monomers prior to cell division. In Escherichia coli, dimer resolution is achieved by site-specific recombination, Xer recombination, involving two paralogous tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, and a 28-bp recombination site (dif) located at the junction of the two replication arms. Xer recombination is tightly controlled by the septal protein FtsK. XerCD recombinases and FtsK are found on most sequenced eubacterial genomes, suggesting that the Xer recombination system as described in E. coli is highly conserved among prokaryotes. We show here that Streptococci and Lactococci carry an alternative Xer recombination machinery, organized in a single recombination module. This corresponds to an atypical 31-bp recombination site (dif(SL)) associated with a dedicated tyrosine recombinase (XerS). In contrast to the E. coli Xer system, only a single recombinase is required to recombine dif(SL), suggesting a different mechanism in the recombination process. Despite this important difference, XerS can only perform efficient recombination when dif(SL) sites are located on chromosome dimers. Moreover, the XerS/dif(SL) recombination requires the streptococcal protein FtsK(SL), probably without the need for direct protein-protein interaction, which we demonstrated to be located at the division septum of Lactococcus lactis. Acquisition of the XerS recombination module can be considered as a landmark of the separation of Streptococci/Lactococci from other firmicutes and support the view that Xer recombination is a conserved cellular function in bacteria, but that can be achieved by functional analogs.

N2  - <jats:p>The life cycle of a species of the genus <jats:italic>Bougainvillia</jats:italic> (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa), found in the southern Mediterranean Sea, Italy, is here described. Hydroid colonies produced immature medusae with two tentacles and two ocelli per bulb and four unbranched oral tentacles. The number of tentacles and ocelli, which remained constant during the entire life cycle, are here considered diagnostic characters to identify the present as a new species. Female medusae lived up to 47 days (with an average of 30 days) when reared at 17°C, while males, reared at the same temperature, were short-lived, concluding their life cycle in no more than 15 days. The medusa of this species resembles <jats:italic>B. ramosa</jats:italic> var. <jats:italic>nana</jats:italic> described by Hartlaub in 1911 on the basis of few specimens and no polyp stage. After the complete life cycle has been observed, and given its peculiar medusa stage, Hartlaub's subspecies (variant) must be promoted to species rank as <jats:italic>Bougainvillia nana</jats:italic>.</jats:p>

N2  - Blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whales (B. physalus) produce high-intensity, low-frequency calls, which probably function for communication during mating and feeding. The source levels of blue and fin whale calls off the Western Antarctic Peninsula were calculated using recordings made with calibrated, bottom-moored hydrophones. Blue whales were located up to a range of 200 km using hyperbolic localization and time difference of arrival. The distance to fin whales, estimated using multipath arrivals of their calls, was up to 56 km. The error in range measurements was 3.8 km using hyperbolic localization, and 3.4 km using multipath arrivals. Both species produced high-intensity calls; the average blue whale call source level was 189+/-3 dB re:1 microPa-1 m over 25-29 Hz, and the average fin whale call source level was 189+/-4 dB re:1 microPa-1 m over 15-28 Hz. Blue and fin whale populations in the Southern Ocean have remained at low numbers for decades since they became protected; using source level and detection range from passive acoustic recordings can help in calculating the relative density of calling whales.

N2  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (dioxins) are persistent contaminants that bioaccumulate and pose serious risks to humans. The primary objective of this study was to determine the history and mechanisms of dioxin accumulation in sediments of the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) using analytical data on natural and anthropogenic radionuclides (7Be, 137Cs, and 210Pb) and dioxins. Results showed that present-day sedimentary dioxin accumulation rates are orders of magnitude higher than atmospheric inputs to the HSC. Most stations showed dioxin peaks in the near surface, indicating continuing inputs despite federal regulations. Stations with high dioxin inventories reflect accentuated accumulation in the HSC as one moves west toward Houston, at the confluence of the HSC and the San Jacinto River and upstream in the San Jacinto River. These results indicate that a significant quantity of dioxins continues to be released into the environment here or that sedimentary storage and release of previously supplied dioxins is significant, or both. The results support the interpretation that the HSC is influenced by episodic sediment resuspension, erosion and lateral transport processes driven by tides, wind, shipping, and dredging, which can cause intermittently high accumulations of dioxins, and underscores the need for additional research on the roles of sedimentary processes in organic contaminant bioavailability.

N2  - <jats:p>Although there is a growing body of research examining public perceptions of global climate change, little work has focused on the role of place and proximity in shaping these perceptions. This study extends previous conceptual models explaining risk perception associated with global climate change by adding a spatial dimension. Specifically, Geographic Information Systems and spatial analytical techniques are used to map and measure survey respondents' physical risk associated with expected climate change. Using existing spatial data, multiple measures of climate change vulnerability are analyzed along with demographic, attitudinal, and social contextual variables derived from a representative national survey to predict variation in risk perception. Bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses are used to identify and explain the most important indicators shaping individual risk perception. Analysis of the data suggests that the relationship between actual and perceived risk is driven by specific types of physical conditions and experiences.</jats:p>

Fibrates are used to prevent cardiovascular disease through their antilipidemic activity. In a series of experiments, in which fish were exposed to waterborne Clofibric acid, no convincing, reproducible antilipidemic effects were observed. In contrast, in three separate experiments, Clofibric acid affected the reproductive axis of fish. Spermatogenesis was apparently impaired, leading to a marked reduction in sperm count in two of the three experiments. Various measures of sperm motility were also reduced, although only significantly so at the highest concentration of Clofibric acid tested (1mg/L). There were also indications that plasma androgen concentrations were reduced. These effects of Clofibric acid on the reproductive axis of fish are similar to those that occur in some mammals as a side-effect of the drug. Taken together, a weight-of-evidence argument would suggest that the main discernable effect of Clofibric acid on fish is likely to be a reproductive, not an antilipidemic, one. Although some of these reproductive effects of Clofibric acid occurred only at a high concentration (1mg/L), others occurred at lower concentrations (microg/litre), near or similar to those reported in the aquatic environment (ng to low microg/litre range). Although we recognise that this is not a definitive study of the effects of Clofibric acid on fish reproduction, the results strongly suggest that Clofibric acid could adversely affect sperm parameters and androgen concentrations in adult Fathead minnows. Further studies are warranted. This may be an example of a drug in which an accidentally discovered side-effect found in mammals turns out to be the most important effect in a different vertebrate group, namely fish.

N2  - <jats:p>Eleven stygobitic myodocopid ostracodes (two new–Danielopolina palmeri and Spelaeoecia hox) in the Order Halocyprida are reported from anchialine waters in 11 inland blue holes in Bahamas. One stygobitic halocyprid ostracode is reported from two localities in Bermuda, and one from a cave in Mexico. A new subfamily, Spelaeoeciinae, is proposed to contain the genus Spelaeoecia, and the subfamily Deeveyinae is elevated to family status. Two new species of cladocopid ostracode (Pseudopolycope helix and Pontopolycope storthynx), are described from a cave in Mexico and an oceanic blue hole in the Bahamas. Nine species of myodocopid ostracodes (four new—Rutiderma flex, Eusarsiella syrinx, Eusarsiella fax, and Synasterope matrix) in the Suborder Myodocopina and one species in the Suborder Halocypridina are reported from ocean blue holes in the Bahamas. This is the first report of a halocyprid living in both an inland and ocean blue hole in the Bahamas. The sarsiellid genus Dantya Kornicker &amp; Cohen 1978 is reported for the first time in the Bahamas, but the single juvenile specimen is left in open nomenclature as Dantya sp. A. The development of Deeveya bransoni and Eusarsiella syrinx is described in detail. With the exception of one species of Danielopolina from deep waters of the South Atlantic, all other species of Danielopolina, Spelaeoecia and Deeveya have been previously found only in inland, anchialine caves. The discovery of Deeveya inhabiting deeper, hydrologically-isolated waters in ocean blue holes, which are otherwise comparable to classical anchialine environments, has raised questions concerning the geographic limits to the anchialine habitat and its supposed reliance on terrestrial inputs.</jats:p>

N2  - Floods continue to pose the greatest threat to the property and safety of human communities among all natural hazards in the United States. This study examines the relationship between the built environment and flood impacts in Texas, which consistently sustains the most damage from flooding of any other state in the country. Specifically, we calculate property damage resulting from 423 flood events between 1997 and 2001 at the county level. We identify the effect of several built environment measures, including wetland alteration, impervious surface, and dams on reported property damage while controlling for biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. Statistical results suggest that naturally occurring wetlands play a particularly important role in mitigating flood damage. These findings provide guidance to planners and flood managers on how to alleviate most effectively the costly impacts of foods at the community level.

N2  - To better understand how elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) use negative buoyancy to reduce energy metabolism and prolong dive duration, we modelled the energetic cost of transit and deep foraging dives in an elephant seal. A numerical integration technique was used to model the effects of swim speed, descent and ascent angles, and modes of locomotion (i.e. stroking and gliding) on diving metabolic rate, aerobic dive limit, vertical displacement (maximum dive depth) and horizontal displacement (maximum horizontal distance along a straight line between the beginning and end locations of the dive) for aerobic transit and foraging dives. Realistic values of the various parameters were taken from previous experimental data. Our results indicate that there is little energetic advantage to transit dives with gliding descent compared with horizontal swimming beneath the surface. Other factors such as feeding and predator avoidance may favour diving to depth during migration. Gliding descent showed variable energy savings for foraging dives. Deep mid-water foraging dives showed the greatest energy savings (approx. 18%) as a result of gliding during descent. In contrast, flat-bottom foraging dives with horizontal swimming at a depth of 400m showed less of an energetic advantage with gliding descent, primarily because more of the dive involved stroking. Additional data are needed before the advantages of gliding descent can be fully understood for male and female elephant seals of different age and body composition. This type of data will require animal-borne instruments that can record the behaviour, three-dimensional movements and locomotory performance of free-ranging animals at depth.

N2  - Biotin-4-fluorescein (B4F) is a convenient molecular probe for (strept)avidin and for unlabeled biotin in homogeneous fluorescence assays. The primary standard is a 16 microM working solution of d-biotin which is used to titrate an aliquot of a (strept)avidin stock solution while monitoring the tryptophane fluorescence of (strept)avidin. This serves to standardize the (strept)avidin stock solution, an aliquot of which is then titrated with a roughly 16 microM working solution of B4F while monitoring the fluorescence of B4F. Specific binding is accompanied by quenching, but after saturation of all binding sites, the appearance of free ligand causes a sharp rise of intense fluorescence, the beginning of which allows to calculate the effective concentration of B4F in the working solution. Measurement of avidin in a crude sample is exemplified by mixing 8 pmol of B4F with various amounts of diluted egg white in a volume of 1 mL. Hereby, the extent of fluorescence quenching linearly correlates with the concentration of functional avidin. Moreover, a sharp minimum of fluorescence is observed when exactly 2 pmol of avidin is present in the sample. The latter assay has been adapted to measure between 0.5 and 5 pmol of d-biotin in 1 mL of sample by adding 1.9 pmol of avidin and 8 pmol of B4F. This competitive assay correctly measures the small dose of d-biotin in multivitamin tablets (e.g., 150 microg in 5 g of solid) after subtracting the background fluorescence of the colored aqueous solution.

N2  - <jats:p>During the past several years, workforce issues have immerged as a dominant concern for shipbuilding and repair companies. Related issues include concern about “aging” of the workforce, lack of basic technical education, career transition processes, recruitment and training of the new workforce, retention and training of the incumbent workforce, image of the industry, and lack of career information for middle and high school students. Large turnover combined with retirement of aging workforce is anticipated to create large demands for qualified workforce. The Shipbuilding and Repair Career Day Events (SBRCD) project was conceived in response to this critical need of workforce in shipbuilding and repair industry. This project was funded by the National Shipbuilding research Program to increase awareness about careers in marine industry. The paper discusses the multi-pronged effort within the SBRCD project to inform and engage middle and high school students, teachers and counselors about career opportunities in this industry. The paper also discusses the design and development of four simulation activities known as marine kits to engage students in shipbuilding related projects. These activities are tied to Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) so teachers can use them in classrooms without loosing time. The Marine Kits were pilot tested and results are discussed.</jats:p>

N2  - Mechanisms influencing species richness are many. Recent theoretical research revealed additional mechanisms that involved neutral and lumpy coexistence and alternating assemblage states. These mechanisms can lead to conditions where the number of coexisting species is greater than the number of limiting resources, that is, species supersaturation. Our research focused on the role of disturbances (migration and pulsed through-flows) in supersaturated plankton systems. Our simulations employed 30 different supersaturated assemblages generated by using various ecological principals. Our findings indicated that immigration rates as low as 0.1% of total biomass per day generally led to regional homogenization of species and dramatic extinction events, with assemblages characteristic of lumpy coexistence being more resilient than those characteristic of neutral coexistence or alternating states. Generally, pulsed through-flows tended to offset, to some extent, the negative effects of migration. The precipitous loss of species with the onset of migration is observed in other systems as well, for example, cichlid fish communities of East Africa rift lakes and songbird assemblages from Indian Ocean islands. While many explanations have been offered to explain postimmigration extinctions in species-rich systems, another explanation might be that the assemblages in these systems are in a fragile state of supersaturated coexistence.

N2  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated genes are linked to a mechanism of acquired resistance against bacteriophages. Bacteria can integrate short stretches of phage-derived sequences (spacers) within CRISPR loci to become phage resistant. In this study, we further characterized the efficiency of CRISPR1 as a phage resistance mechanism in Streptococcus thermophilus. First, we show that CRISPR1 is distinct from previously known phage defense systems and is effective against the two main groups of S. thermophilus phages. Analyses of 30 bacteriophage-insensitive mutants of S. thermophilus indicate that the addition of one new spacer in CRISPR1 is the most frequent outcome of a phage challenge and that the iterative addition of spacers increases the overall phage resistance of the host. The added new spacers have a size of between 29 to 31 nucleotides, with 30 being by far the most frequent. Comparative analysis of 39 newly acquired spacers with the complete genomic sequences of the wild-type phages 2972, 858, and DT1 demonstrated that the newly added spacer must be identical to a region (named proto-spacer) in the phage genome to confer a phage resistance phenotype. Moreover, we found a CRISPR1-specific sequence (NNAGAAW) located downstream of the proto-spacer region that is important for the phage resistance phenotype. Finally, we show through the analyses of 20 mutant phages that virulent phages are rapidly evolving through single nucleotide mutations as well as deletions, in response to CRISPR1.

N2  - Feeding kinematics, suction and hydraulic jetting capabilities of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were characterized during controlled feeding trials. Feeding trials were conducted both on land and in water, and allowed a choice between suction and biting, but food was also presented that could be ingested by suction alone. Four feeding phases, preparatory, jaw opening, hyoid depression and jaw closing were observed; the mean feeding cycle duration was 0.54+/-0.22 s, regardless of feeding mode (P>0.05). Subjects feeding on land used biting and suction 89.3% and 10.7% of the time, respectively. Subjects feeding in water used suction and hydraulic jetting 96.3% and 3.7% of the time, respectively. No biting behavior was observed underwater. Suction feeding was characterized by a small gape (2.7+/-0.85 cm), small gape angle (24.4+/-8.13 degrees ), pursing of the rostral lips to form a circular aperture, and pursing of the lateral lips to occlude lateral gape. Biting was characterized by large gape (7.3+/-2.2 cm), large gape angle (41.7+/-15.2 degrees ), and lip curling to expose the teeth. An excavation behavior in which suction and hydraulic jetting were alternated was used to extract food from recessed wells. The maximum subambient and suprambient pressures recorded were 91.2 and 53.4 kPa, respectively. The inclusion of suction data for phocids broadens the principle that suction feeding kinematics is conserved among aquatic vertebrates. Furthermore, bearded seals support predictions that mouth size, fluid flow speed, and elusiveness of prey consumed are among a suite of traits that determine the specific nature of suction feeding among species.

N2  - <jats:p> Climate change and mitigation policies adopted by a locality indelibly impact urban form, landscape, and economy. The Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) has become a dominant movement organizing the localities to proactively address climate change. This study examines metropolitan area commitment to the CCP. Geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical techniques are used to analyze metros on dimensions of climate change risk, stress, and civic capacity. “Climate change risk” measures a metro area's coastal proximity, ecosystem sensitivity, and susceptibility to extreme weather events. “Climate change stress” summarizes transportation, energy, and production practices that adversely affect climate systems. “Civic capacity” estimates human capital and environmental concern variables that constitute a metro area's ability to commit to policy initiatives. Statistical results indicate that high stressor areas are significantly less likely to participate in the CCP campaign, and metros high in civic capacity are significantly more likely to commit to the CCP campaign. </jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p> The Kačák Event in the Middle Devonian (Eifelian–Givetian (E–G) boundary) is a period of apparent global anoxia coincident with widespread deposition of black shale in hemipelagic, pelagic, and some neritic facies. Conodont biostratigraphy in the North American Appalachian Basin has proven to be problematic in precisely demarcating the E–G boundary. In this study, we show that the E–G boundary may be defined more accurately through isotope stratigraphy (δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C) in conjunction with a conodont faunal change across this boundary, identified as the Kačák– otomari Event. The Canadian Hamilton Group outcropping in Hungry Hollow, Ontario, is a 22 m sedimentary succession spanning the Middle Devonian. Conodont biostratigraphy for this section makes it difficult to define the E–G boundary, but the otomari Event can be detected. High-resolution isotopic analysis of bulk sedimentary carbonate and organic matter for this succession records a significant negative δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C excursion (δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>carb</jats:sub> = up to 2‰; δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> = ∼3.0‰) that is synchronous with total organic carbon (TOC) values up to 12.5%. We identify this negative δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C excursion as a result of marine anoxia associated with the Kačák–otomari Event and suggest that the excursion is a global event driven by a source of isotopically light carbon, followed by a productivity event, similar to Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events. Such similarities between Devonian and Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events may become more evident with increased high-resolution isotopic and geochemical investigations of Devonian successions. </jats:p>

N2  - Developments in nanotechnology are leading to a rapid proliferation of new materials that are likely to become a source of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to the environment, where their possible ecotoxicological impacts remain unknown. The surface properties of ENPs are of essential importance for their aggregation behavior, and thus for their mobility in aquatic and terrestrial systems and for their interactions with algae, plants and, fungi. Interactions of ENPs with natural organic matter have to be considered as well, as those will alter the ENPs aggregation behavior in surface waters or in soils. Cells of plants, algae, and fungi possess cell walls that constitute a primary site for interaction and a barrier for the entrance of ENPs. Mechanisms allowing ENPs to pass through cell walls and membranes are as yet poorly understood. Inside cells, ENPs might directly provoke alterations of membranes and other cell structures and molecules, as well as protective mechanisms. Indirect effects of ENPs depend on their chemical and physical properties and may include physical restraints (clogging effects), solubilization of toxic ENP compounds, or production of reactive oxygen species. Many questions regarding the bioavailability of ENPs, their uptake by algae, plants, and fungi and the toxicity mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

N2  - Domain wall dynamics in magnetic nanodots is critical to the understanding of the magnetization reversal mechanisms in bit-patterned arrays, the issues of writeablility, data rate maximization, and bit stability. In this work, micromagnetic simulations were carried out to investigate the dynamics of domain walls in disk-shaped nanostructures with large built-in perpendicular anisotropy. Due to the strong demagnetizing effect, the domain wall motion falls into the supercritical regime. A 90 degrees phase shift of the wall velocity is developed due to the finite thicknesses. The mean value of the wall velocity increases as the domain wall propagates away from the center. This induced asymmetry causes the frequency of the wall oscillations to be halved. At large diameters, the wall acceleration deceases and the periodicity is lost. The in-plane magnetization configuration shows that multiple spin wave modes are present. The absence of the coherency in the magnetization orientations causes phase canceling. The out-of-phase motion of neighboring segments reduces the wall acceleration.

Using geographic information systems analytic techniques, we map and measure a locality's vulnerability to climate-change impacts at the county level of spatial precision. We analyze multiple measures of climate-change vulnerability, including expected temperature change, extreme weather events, and coastal proximity, as well as economic variables, demographic variables, and civic-participation variables that constitute a locality's socioeconomic capacity to commit to costly climate-change policy initiatives. Bivariate and logistic regression results indicate that CCP-committed localities are quantitatively different to noncommitted localities on both climate-change risk and socioeconomic-capacity dimensions. On vulnerability measures, the odds of CCP-campaign participation increase significantly with the number of people killed and injured by extreme weather events, projected temperature change, and coastal proximity. On socioeconomic-capacity measures, the odds of CCP-campaign involvement increase with the percentage of citizens that vote Democrat and recycle, as well as the number of nonprofit organizations with an environment focus. The odds decrease in a county area as the percentage of the labor force employed in carbon-intensive industries increases. </jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Hydroidolina is a group of hydrozoans that includes Anthoathecata, Leptothecata and Siphonophorae. Previous phylogenetic analyses show strong support for Hydroidolina monophyly, but the relationships between and within its subgroups remain uncertain. In an effort to further clarify hydroidolinan relationships, we performed phylogenetic analyses on 97 hydroidolinan taxa, using DNA sequences from partial mitochondrial 16S rDNA, nearly complete nuclear 18S rDNA and nearly complete nuclear 28S rDNA. Our findings are consistent with previous analyses that support monophyly of Siphonophorae and Leptothecata and do not support monophyly of Anthoathecata nor its component subgroups, Filifera and Capitata. Instead, within Anthoathecata, we find support for four separate filiferan clades and two separate capitate clades (Aplanulata and Capitata<jats:italic>sensu stricto</jats:italic>). Our data however, lack any substantive support for discerning relationships between these eight distinct hydroidolinan clades.</jats:p>

N2  - Several flatfish species, including southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) recruit to estuaries during early life. Therefore, evaluation of estuarine sites and habitats that serve as nurseries is critical to conservation and management. The present study used density data in conjunction with biochemical condition and growth measurements to evaluate settlement sites used by southern flounder in the Galveston Bay Estuary (GBE). In 2005, beam-trawl collections were made in three major sections of the GBE (East Bay, Galveston Bay, West Bay). Three sites were sampled in each bay. Within each sampling site, replicate collections were taken from three habitats: 1) marsh edge (< 1 m depth), 2) intermediate zone (10-20 m from marsh interface; ∼ 1 m depth), and 3) bay zone (typically > 100 m from marsh interface; depth > 1 m). Average size of southern flounder collected was 12-19 mm standard length, and peak densities occurred in January and February. Catch data indicated that densities of southern flounder were significantly greater in East Bay (2.75 per 100 m2) than in Galveston Bay (0.91 per 100 m2) or in West Bay (0.45 per 100 m2). Densities were statistically similar among habitats. Otolith-based estimates of age indicated that the majority of southern flounder collected were 35-45 days old and derived from early December to early January hatch-dates. Growth rates were similar among bays and among habitats, with the average growth rate being 0.40 mm day- 1 (range: 0.21-0.76 mm day- 1). RNA:DNA was above the established baseline value for nutritional stress, indicating that newly settled southern flounder in the GBE were in relatively high condition. Habitat-specific differences in RNA:DNA ratios were not observed; however, ratios were significantly lower in West Bay (average 8.0) than in East Bay (average 9.5) or in Galveston Bay (average 9.8), suggesting the condition of new recruits may vary spatially within the GBE. Findings from the current study suggest density and condition of newly settled southern flounder vary at the bay scale, suggesting that parts of GBE do not function equally as nurseries. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Our objective was to determine the ontogenetic changes in the skeletal muscles of Weddell seals that transform a non-diving pup into an elite diving adult. Muscle biopsies were collected from pups, juveniles and adults and analyzed for changes in fiber type, mitochondrial density, myoglobin concentrations and aerobic, lipolytic and anaerobic enzyme activities. The fiber type results demonstrated a decrease in slow-twitch oxidative (Type I) fibers and a significant increase in fast-twitch oxidative (Type IIA) fibers as the animals mature. In addition, the volume density of mitochondria and the activity of lipolytic enzymes significantly decreased as the seals matured. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative account describing a decrease in aerobic fibers shifting towards an increase in fast-twitch oxidative fibers with a significant decrease in mitochondrial density as animals mature. These differences in the muscle physiology of Weddell seals are potentially due to their three very distinct stages of life history: non-diving pup, novice diving juvenile, and elite deep diving adult. During the first few weeks of life, pups are a non-diving terrestrial mammal that must rely on lanugo (natal fur) for thermoregulation in the harsh conditions of Antarctica. The increased aerobic capacity of pups, associated with increased mitochondrial volumes, acts to provide additional thermogenesis. As these future elite divers mature, their skeletal muscles transform to a more sedentary state in order to maintain the low levels of aerobic metabolism associated with long-duration diving.

N2  - The bioavailability of total organic carbon (TOC) was examined in ground water from two hydrologically distinct aquifers using biochemical indicators widely employed in chemical oceanography. Concentrations of total hydrolyzable neutral sugars (THNS), total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA), and carbon-normalized percentages of TOC present as THNS and THAA (referred to as "yields") were assessed as indicators of bioavailability. A shallow coastal plain aquifer in Kings Bay, Georgia, was characterized by relatively high concentrations (425 to 1492 microM; 5.1 to 17.9 mg/L) of TOC but relatively low THNS and THAA yields (approximately 0.2%-1.0%). These low yields are consistent with the highly biodegraded nature of TOC mobilized from relatively ancient (Pleistocene) sediments overlying the aquifer. In contrast, a shallow fractured rock aquifer in West Trenton, New Jersey, exhibited lower TOC concentrations (47 to 325 microM; 0.6 to 3.9 mg/L) but higher THNS and THAA yields (approximately 1% to 4%). These higher yields were consistent with the younger, and thus more bioavailable, TOC being mobilized from modern soils overlying the aquifer. Consistent with these apparent differences in TOC bioavailability, no significant correlation between TOC and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), a product of organic carbon mineralization, was observed at Kings Bay, whereas a strong correlation was observed at West Trenton. In contrast to TOC, THNS and THAA concentrations were observed to correlate with DIC at the Kings Bay site. These observations suggest that biochemical indicators such as THNS and THAA may provide information concerning the bioavailability of organic carbon present in ground water that is not available from TOC measurements alone.

N2  - Dollo's Law, the idea that the loss of complex features in evolution is irreversible, is a popular concept in evolutionary biology. Here we review how application of recent phylogenetic methods, genomics and evo-devo approaches is changing our view of Dollo's Law and its underlying mechanisms. Phylogenetic studies have recently demonstrated cases where seemingly complex features such as digits and wings have been reacquired. Meanwhile, large genomics databases and evo-devo studies are showing how the underlying developmental pathways and genetic architecture can be retained after the loss of a character. With dwindling evidence for the law-like nature of Dollo's Law, we anticipate a return to Dollo's original focus on irreversibility of all kinds of changes, not exclusively losses.

N2  - Coding sequences are a simple and natural means of representing graphs. In applying coding sequences to graphs in non-orientable surfaces, we clarify on what it means for a graph to be 2-cell embedded in the Möbius band and in the projective plane; in particular, examples are given of the degenerate situation where the complement of a face in the projective plane is not a true Möbius band. Taking the matter of degeneracy into account, via coding sequences, we give rigorous proofs of Euler characteristic formulas for non-orientable surfaces. The matter of degeneracy had not been previously considered in this context. © 2008 Pushpa Publishing House.

N2  - <jats:p>This study documents ontogenetic habitat shifts of red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ) and highlights possible impacts of shrimp trawling on age-0 fish life history parameters on the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) continental shelf. Red snapper were collected quarterly during 2004 and 2005 over sand, low-relief shell rubble, high-relief shell rubble, and natural high-relief reef habitats within a de facto nontrawl area and in similar habitats on the open shelf where commercial shrimp trawling occurred. Age-0 red snapper were most dense over sand and low-relief shell rubble habitats and moved to higher-relief shell rubble and natural reef habitats by age-1. Habitat-specific daily growth rates of age-0 fish were highest over sand (range 0.65–1.03 mm·day<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>). Densities of age-0 red snapper were highest over trawled sand, but higher over nontrawled shell rubble by 6 months of age (age-0.5+). Red snapper collected over sand and low-relief shell rubble areas exposed to trawling had truncated size distributions, higher mortality estimates, and lower production potential (the latter evaluated with G–Z and P–B ratios) compared with fish over nontrawled areas of similar habitat. Results suggest that juvenile red snapper residing over nontrawled areas may have a higher probability of survival than fish in areas exposed to commercial shrimp trawling.</jats:p>

N2  - Studies on the impacts of hurricanes, tropical storms, and tornados indicate that poor communities of colour suffer disproportionately in human death and injury.(2) Few quantitative studies have been conducted on the degree to which flood events affect socially vulnerable populations. We address this research void by analysing 832 countywide flood events in Texas from 1997-2001. Specifically, we examine whether geographic localities characterised by high percentages of socially vulnerable populations experience significantly more casualties due to flood events, adjusting for characteristics of the natural and built environment. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models indicate that the odds of a flood casualty increase with the level of precipitation on the day of a flood event, flood duration, property damage caused by the flood, population density, and the presence of socially vulnerable populations. Odds decrease with the number of dams, the level of precipitation on the day before a recorded flood event, and the extent to which localities have enacted flood mitigation strategies. The study concludes with comments on hazard-resilient communities and protection of casualty-prone populations.

N2  - Atlantic bluefin tuna populations are in steep decline, and an improved understanding of connectivity between individuals from eastern (Mediterranean Sea) and western (Gulf of Mexico) spawning areas is needed to manage remaining fisheries. Chemical signatures in the otoliths of yearlings from regional nurseries were distinct and served as natural tags to assess natal homing and mixing. Adults showed high rates of natal homing to both eastern and western spawning areas. Trans-Atlantic movement (east to west) was significant and size-dependent, with individuals of Mediterranean origin mixing with the western population in the U.S. Atlantic. The largest (oldest) bluefin tuna collected near the northern extent of their range in North American waters were almost exclusively of western origin, indicating that this region represents critical habitat for the western population.

N2  - Relatively recently, inorganic colloids have been invoked to reconcile the apparent contradictions between expectations based on classical dissolved-phase Pu transport and field observations of "enhanced" Pu mobility (Kersting et al. Nature 1999, 397, 56-59). A new paradigm for Pu transport is mobilization and transport via biologically produced ligands. This study for the first time reports a new finding of Pu being transported, at sub-pM concentrations, by a cutin-like natural substance containing siderophore-like moieties and virtually all mobile Pu. Most likely, Pu is complexed by chelating groups derived from siderophores that are covalently bound to a backbone of cutin-derived soil degradation products, thus revealing the history of initial exposure to Pu. Features such as amphiphilicity and small size make this macromolecule an ideal collector for actinides and other metals and a vector for their dispersal. Cross-linking to the hydrophobic domains (e.g., by polysaccharides) gives this macromolecule high mobility and a means of enhancing Pu transport. This finding provides a new mechanism for Pu transport through environmental systems that would not have been predicted by Pu transport models.

Habitat use and the effect of shrimp trawling on fish and invertebrate communities over the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 1610–1619. The goals of this study were to characterize habitat-specific fish and invertebrate community structure over sand, shell-rubble, and natural reef substrata, and to assess the effects of trawling on the sand and shell-rubble habitats and their associated communities during quarterly trawl surveys over a 2-year period. Fish and invertebrate communities differed significantly among habitat types [analysis of similarities (ANOSIM); Global R = 0.436, p &lt; 0.001), and with respect to trawling exposure (ANOSIM; Global R = 0.128, p &lt; 0.001). Habitat characteristics were quantified from video transects sampled with a remotely operated vehicle, and included percentage coverage of tubeworms, bryozoans, anemones, corals, and algae, significantly affecting fish community structure. Diversity indices differed among habitats, with the highest Shannon diversity (H′) and Pielou's evenness (J′) over shell-rubble, specifically non-trawled shell-rubble. In addition, higher values of H′ and J′ were found over trawled sand relative to non-trawled sand habitats. Length frequency distributions of several abundant fish species showed truncated size distributions over trawled and non-trawled habitats and were both habitat- and species-specific. The study describes habitat-specific differences in community structure, highlighting the differences between trawled and non-trawled areas on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf.</jats:p>

N2  - Juvenile red snapper settle across several complex habitats, which function as nurseries for young fish. Little is known about their life history or feeding biomechanics during this time. However, recent studies have shown higher growth rates for juveniles located on mud habitats adjacent to low profile reefs, perhaps because of varied prey availability and abundance. To further investigate the habitat needs of juvenile red snapper and test hypotheses of feeding development, individuals were collected from a low profile shell ridge and adjacent mud areas on Freeport Rocks, TX, USA, and divided into three size classes (< or = 3.9, 4.0-5.9, > or = 6.0 cm SL). Output from a dynamic lever model suggested an ontogenetic shift in feeding morphology. Biomechanical modeling also predicted that off-ridge juveniles would have slower, stronger jaws compared with on-ridge juveniles. Kinematic profiles obtained from actual feeding events validated the models' predictive ability. Analysis of prey capture events demonstrated that on-ridge juveniles exhibited larger jaw displacements than off-ridge juveniles. Shape analysis was used to further investigate habitat effects on morphology. Off-ridge juveniles differed from on-ridge juveniles in possessing a deeper head and body. Results from model simulations, kinematic profiles, behavioral observations and shape analysis all compliment the conclusion that on-ridge juveniles exhibited more suction feeding behavior, whereas off-ridge juveniles used more biting behavior. Habitat disparity and possibly available prey composition generated variations in juvenile feeding biomechanics and behavior that may affect recruitment.

N2  - Phytoplankton life forms, including unicells, colonies, pseudocolonies, and multicellular organisms, span a huge size range. The smallest unicells are less than 1 microm3 (e.g. cyanobacteria), while large unicellular diatoms may attain 10(9) microm3, being visible to the naked eye. Phytoplankton includes chemo-organotrophic unicells, colonies and multicellular organisms that depend on symbionts or kleptoplastids for their capacity to photosynthesize. Analyses of physical (transport within cells, diffusion boundary layers, package effect, turgor, and vertical movements) and biotic (grazing, viruses and other parasitoids) factors indicate potential ecological constraints and opportunities that differ among the life forms. There are also variations among life forms in elemental stoichiometry and in allometric relations between biovolume and specific growth. While many of these factors probably have ecological and evolutionary significance, work is needed to establish those that are most important, warranting explicit description in models. Other factors setting limitations on growth rate (selecting slow-growing species) await elucidation.

N2  - <jats:p> The major planning theories provide a theoretical foundation for environmental planning. This study extends the major planning theories and develops a robust conceptual framework to measure the key factors influencing local environmental-plan quality. A random sample of forty Californian local comprehensive land-use plans and associated planning processes is analyzed to identify the critical factors influencing environmental-plan quality. Results from multiple regression analysis indicate that regular updating, environmental-information management and sharing, and planners contribute significantly to local environmental-plan quality. The findings expand established planning theories and practice by suggesting ways to improve local environmental-plan quality. </jats:p>

N2  - Molecular phylogenetics suggests that the Sipuncula fall into the Annelida, although they are morphologically very distinct and lack segmentation. To understand the evolutionary transformations from the annelid to the sipunculan body plan, it is important to reconstruct the ancestral states within the respective clades at all life history stages. Here we reconstruct the ancestral states for the head/introvert retractor muscles and the body wall musculature in the Sipuncula using Bayesian statistics. In addition, we describe the ontogenetic transformations of the two muscle systems in four sipunculan species with different developmental modes, using F-actin staining with fluorescent-labeled phalloidin in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. All four species, which have smooth body wall musculature and less than the full set of four introvert retractor muscles as adults, go through developmental stages with four retractor muscles that are eventually reduced to a lower number in the adult. The circular and sometimes the longitudinal body wall musculature are split into bands that later transform into a smooth sheath. Our ancestral state reconstructions suggest with nearly 100% probability that the ancestral sipunculan had four introvert retractor muscles, longitudinal body wall musculature in bands and circular body wall musculature arranged as a smooth sheath. Species with crawling larvae have more strongly developed body wall musculature than those with swimming larvae. To interpret our findings in the context of annelid evolution, a more solid phylogenetic framework is needed for the entire group and more data on ontogenetic transformations of annelid musculature are desirable.

N2  - The fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) is an OECD-proposed test species routinely used in reproductive toxicity trials with suspected endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). The basic fecundity, endocrinology, and histopathology of reproductively active male and female fathead minnows has been well characterized, but there are few studies of the utility of male sperm concentration and motility as endpoints for use in reproductive trials. The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize the baseline sperm concentration and motility of pair-breeding male fathead minnows over their spawning cycle and (2) determine whether a repeated and nondestructive sperm sampling protocol would influence the baseline fecundity of the fish. Pair-breeding male fathead minnows that underwent sampling for milt three times a week for 4 weeks exhibited no significant changes in milt volume, sperm concentration, or motility parameters up to 6 days after each spawning event. The repeated sperm sampling procedure did, however, cause a significant lowering of spawning frequencies, although this decline did not correlate with effects on fecundity as there were no significant changes in the mean total numbers of eggs laid, fertilization, and hatching successes. This study confirmed the presence of a stable background of sperm concentration and motility parameters of pair-breeding male fathead minnows under reference conditions. The absence of any inherent "cycling" in the magnitude of these parameters over the spawning period suggests that sperm concentration and motility could be useful measures of male reproductive toxicity at the termination of tests in which pair-breeding males are at varying days post spawn.

N2  - Expression level of genes associated with oxygen [cytochrome oxidase 1 (COX1) and myoglobin (Mb)] and glucose utilization [glucose transporters (GLUTs) and hexokinases (HKs)] along with metabolic indices were determined in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) subjected to an hypoxic challenge of <45% oxygen saturation for 24 days. There were two closely related HKs considered to be homologues of mammalian HKIs. HKIa and HKIb share 86% sequence identity and are both ubiquitously expressed. Mb was also expressed in many tissues with highest levels occurring in heart. Over the first 15 days of hypoxia there were transient increases in plasma lactate in hypoxic relative to normoxic fish associated with a significant decrease in liver glycogen. Over days 1-6, there were in ten of eleven cases, increased average (with a number of conditions being statistically significant) expression levels of GLUTs (1, 2, 4) and HKs (1a and b) in gill, heart, liver, and white muscle in hypoxic relative to normoxic fish. There were significant increases in COX1 and Mb expression levels in gill by day 24 but no changes in these aerobic indicators in heart or liver. Overall the data suggest a transient increase in genes associated with glucose utilization during the early part of the hypoxic challenge followed by alterations in gene expression in gill.

N2  - The post-embryonic development of a species of the enigmatic crustacean group Remipedia is described in detail for the first time under various aspects. Applying a molecular approach, we can clearly prove the species identity of the larvae as belonging to Pleomothra apletocheles. We document the cellular level of several larval stages and the differentiation of segments, limbs, and the general body morphology applying the techniques of confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, we document the swimming behavior and the peculiar movements of the naupliar appendages. A comparison of our results with published data on other Crustacea and their larval development tentatively supports ideas about phylogenetic affinities of the Remipedia to the Malacostraca.

N2  - <jats:p>A new species of the crustacean class Remipedia is described, illustrated and compared to closely related taxa. Speleonectes kakuki n. sp. inhabits at least four widely separated anchialine cave systems on the Great Bahama Bank. A total of ten specimens were collected from caves on Andros and Cat Island. Speleonectes kakuki can be distinguished from other species of remipedes by the presence of heteromorphic sternal bars and comparatively robust and pilose prehensile cephalic limbs. It is the first remipede to be collected from an offshore cave, whereas as all previously known remipede habitats are inland sites. The presence of remipedes in sub-seafloor caves is highly significant in that it suggests the anchialine habitat is much more extensive than previously thought and may extend for hundreds of kilometers beneath the shallow waters of limestone banks to link widely separated inland caves.</jats:p>

N2  - The Dickinson Bayou watershed (near Houston, Texas, Gulf of Mexico) provides habitat for numerous coastally influenced communities of wildlife, including scores of birds and fish. Encroaching development and impervious surfaces are altering the habitat and degrading water quality. Herein we have defined the current health of the bayou using water quality data collected between 2000 and 2006. Elevated bacteria (fecal coliform, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus) and depressed dissolved oxygen concentrations (often <3mgl(-1)) are the two major impairments to this ecosystem. While nutrient ratios indicate primary productivity may be nitrogen limited, concerns of eutrophication persist because the bayou has a low intrinsic flushing rate. Consistent with this is the magnitude of algal blooms (ca. 100microg chll(-1)) which often occur in spring/summer. The findings of this study will assist with the understanding of the influence of urban development on small watersheds.

N2  - Floods continue to inflict the most damage upon human communities among all natural hazards in the United States. Because localized flooding tends to be spatially repetitive over time, local decisionmakers often have an opportunity to learn from previous events and make proactive policy adjustments to reduce the adverse effects of a subsequent storm. Despite the importance of understanding the degree to which local jurisdictions learn from flood risks and under what circumstances, little if any empirical, longitudinal research has been conducted along these lines. This article addresses the research gap by examining the change in local flood mitigation policies in Florida from 1999 to 2005. We track 18 different mitigation activities organized into four series of activities under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Community Rating System (CRS) for every local jurisdiction in Florida participating in the FEMA program on a yearly time step. We then identify the major factors contributing to policy changes based on CRS scores over the seven-year study period. Using multivariate statistical models to analyze both natural and social science data, we isolate the effects of several variables categorized into the following groups: hydrologic conditions, flood disaster history, socioeconomic and human capital controls. Results indicate that local jurisdictions do in fact learn from histories of flood risk and this process is expedited under specific conditions.

N2  - The distribution of viral genotypes in the ocean and their evolutionary relatedness remain poorly constrained. This paper presents data on the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships of 1.2-kb DNA polymerase (pol) gene fragments from podoviruses. A newly designed set of PCR primers was used to amplify DNA directly from coastal sediment and water samples collected from inlets adjacent to the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada, and from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 160 cloned PCR products revealed 29 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with OTUs within a site typically being more similar than those among sites. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA pol gene fragments demonstrated high similarity between some environmental sequences and sequences from the marine podoviruses roseophage SIO1 and cyanophage P60, while others were not closely related to sequences from cultured phages. Interrogation of the CAMERA database for sequences from metagenomics data demonstrated that the amplified sequences were representative of the diversity of podovirus pol sequences found in marine samples. Our results indicate high genetic diversity within marine podovirus communities within a small geographic region and demonstrate that the diversity of environmental polymerase gene sequences for podoviruses is far more extensive than previously recognized.

N2  - <jats:p> The rising demand for precision and quality in manufacturing necessitates that vast amounts of manufacturing knowledge be incorporated in manufacturing systems. Surface finish in end milling depends upon a number of variables such as cutting speed, feed rate, spindle speed, radial depth of cut, etc. The relative effect of these variables on surface roughness and machining time is quite considerable. A complex relationship exists between these process parameters and hence there is a need to develop models which can capture this complex interrelationship and enable fast computation of the average surface roughness and machining time based on process parameters. Neuro Fuzzy (NF) modeling has gained prominence recently on account of its fast reaction times, improved ease of operation and flexibility to respond to change in process parameters. In the present work, initially a Neuro Fuzzy Model is trained with experimental results of end milling. Subsequently, a generic approach is developed for optimization of end milling where the applicability and effectiveness of Neuro Fuzzy Model for function approximation is used to rapidly estimate average surface roughness and machining time in an integrated framework of Hybrid Stochastic Search Technique (HSST) to form a Neuro Fuzzy Hybrid Stochastic Search Technique (NFHSST). The results indicate that the NFHSST heuristic converges to better solutions rapidly as it provides the values of various process parameters for optimizing the objectives in a single run. Thus, NFHSST assists in the improvement of quality by developing multiple sound parts in an agile manner. </jats:p>

N2  - The mitochondrial DNA of corals and their anthozoan kin evolves slowly, with substitution rates about two orders of magnitude lower than in typical bilateral animals. This has impeded the delineation of closely related species and isolated populations in corals, compounding problems caused by high morphological plasticity. Here we characterize rates of divergence and levels of variation for three nuclear gene regions, then use these nuclear sequences as markers to test for population structure in Oculina, a taxonomically confused genus of corals. Rates of sequence divergence (obtained by comparison to Solenastrea hyades) were at least five (and sometimes over 10) times faster for the three nuclear markers than for a mitochondrial reference sequence. Nuclear sequence variation was also high within populations, although it tended to decline north of Cape Canaveral. Significant subdivision was evident among samples from 10 locations from between North Carolina and the Florida Panhandle, but neither nominal species designation nor population depth explained much of this variation. Instead, a single population from the unique deep (> 70 m) water reefs at the Oculina Banks off central Florida was a strong genetic outlier: all pairwise measures of subdivision involving this population were greater than those involving all other populations, and multilocus clustering recognized the Oculina Banks as distinct from other populations, despite its close proximity (< or = 36 km) to populations from shallower waters nearby and its location at the centre of the sampled range. Genetic isolation of the Oculina Banks population suggests that focused efforts will be needed to conserve the foundation species of these monotypic reefs and that depth may play a role in isolating marine populations and perhaps facilitating initial steps towards speciation.

N2  - In this study, we report that silver ions (Ag(+)) from the oxidative dissolution of silver engineered nanoparticles (Ag-ENs) determined the EN toxicity to the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. Most of the Ag-ENs formed non-toxic aggregates (>0.22 microm) in seawater. When the free Ag(+) concentration ([Ag(+)](F)) was greatly reduced by diafiltration or thiol complexation, no toxicity was observed, even though the Ag-ENs were better dispersed in the presence of thiols with up to 1.08 x 10(-5) M Ag-ENs found in the <0.22 microm fraction, which are orders of magnitude higher than predicted for the natural aquatic environment. The secretion of polysaccharide-rich algal exopolymeric substances (EPS) significantly increased at increasing [Ag(+)](F). Both dissolved and particulate polysaccharide concentrations were higher for nutrient-limited cells, coinciding with their higher Ag(+) tolerance, suggesting that EPS may be involved in Ag(+) detoxification.

N2  - Different chemical extractants (NaCl, EDTA, HCl and NaOH) and physical methods (ultrasonication and heating) were examined by their efficacies of extracting "attached" exopolymeric substances (EPS) secreted by marine bacterium Sagittula stellata (SS) and terrestrial bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Biovar II (PF). Extraction by 0.5 N HCl for 3 h was best for SS while extraction by 0.05 N NaCl for 3-5 h was regarded as optimal for PF. Improvements in EPS purification included a pre-diafiltration step to remove the broth material and reduce the solution volume, thus the usage of ethanol, and time. The EPS harvested at the optimal time and purified by the improved method were enriched in polysaccharides, with smaller amounts of proteins, thus having amphiphilic properties. Isoelectric focusing of (234)Th or (240)Pu labeled EPS showed both actinides were strongly bound to macromolecules with low pI, similar to reported marine or soil colloidal natural organic matter (NOM).

Rockfish sounds and their potential use for population monitoring in the Southern California Bight. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 981–990. Non-lethal methods are being developed to assess and monitor the depleted rockfish stocks off southern California. For example, data from multifrequency echosounders and underwater cameras have been combined to map the dispersions and estimate the abundances of rockfish at the historical fishing sites within this region. From August to October 2007, this ship-based technique was augmented with two passive-acoustic moored recorders. One collected data at the 43 Fathom Bank for 46 days, while the other was serially deployed at 13 locations for shorter periods (1–8 d). Passive-acoustic data were analysed for the presence of rockfish sounds. Potential sources of five pulsing sounds were identified from the optically estimated species compositions at each location, as well as from known rockfish recordings collected in aquaria. All sounds had a low frequency (&lt;900 Hz). Some were short, individual pulses (≤0.1 s), others were repetitive. A repetitive pulsing from bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis) was the most commonly recorded sound and it occurred mainly at night. The daily calling rates at each site were quantitatively compared with the rockfish abundance estimates obtained from the active-acoustic survey, and they were positively correlated. The feasibility of using passive-acoustic tools to monitor changes in rockfish populations efficiently is discussed.</jats:p>

N2  - Strong interactions between top-down (consumptive) and bottom-up (resource supply) trophic factors occur in many aquatic communities, but these forces can act independently in some microphytobenthic communities. Within benthic estuarine diatom assemblages, the dynamics of these interactions and how they vary with abiotic environmental conditions are not well understood. We conducted a field experiment at two sites with varying habitat characteristics to investigate the interactive effects of grazers and nutrients on benthic estuarine diatoms. We crossed snail (Cerithidea californica) and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) addition treatments in enclosures on a restored tidal sandflat and a reference tidal mudflat in Mugu Lagoon, southern California. We repeated the study in summer 2000 and spring 2001 to assess temporal variation in the interactions. Snails caused a large decrease in diatom relative abundance and biomass (estimated as surface area); nutrients increased diatom abundance but did not alter diatom biomass. Snails and nutrients both reduced average diatom length, although the nutrient effect was weaker and temporally variable, occurring in the reference mudflat in the spring. There were few interactions between snail and nutrient addition treatments, suggesting that links between top-down and bottom-up forces on the diatom community were weak. There were no consistent differences in diatom assemblage characteristics between the two study sites, despite marked differences in sediment grain size and other abiotic characteristics between the sites. The strong diatom response to herbivores and weaker responses to enrichment differed from the previous studies where cyanobacteria increased in response to nutrient enrichment, further dissolving the "black box" perception of microphytobenthic communities.

N2  - A field experiment was employed in Florida Bay investigating the response of seagrass epiphyte communities to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions. While most of the variability in epiphyte community structure was related to uncontrolled temporal and spatial environmental heterogeneity, P additions increased the relative abundance of the red algae-cyanobacterial complex and green algae, with a concomitant decrease in diatoms. When N was added along with P, the observed changes to the diatoms and the red algae-cyanobacterial complex were in the same direction as P-only treatments, but the responses were decreased in magnitude. Within the diatom community, species relative abundances, species richness, and diversity responded weakly to nutrient addition. P additions produced changes in diatom community structure that were limited to summer and were stronger in eastern Florida Bay than in the western bay. These changes were consistent with well-established temporal and spatial patterns of P limitation. Despite the significant change in community structure resulting from P addition, diatom communities from the same site and time, regardless of nutrient treatment, remained more similar to one another than to the diatom communities subject to identical nutrient treatments from different sites and times. Overall, epiphyte communities exhibited responses to P addition that were most evident at the division level.

N2  - The harmful algal bloom species Prymnesium parvum has caused millions of dollars in damage to fisheries around the world. These fish kills have been attributed to P. parvum releasing a mixture of toxins in the water. The characterized toxins, reported as prymnesin-1 and -2, have structural similarities consistent with other known ionizable compounds (e.g., ammonia). We investigated whether pH affects the toxicity of P. parvum under conditions representative of inland Texas reservoirs experiencing ambient toxicity from bloom formation. We evaluated pH influences on toxicity in laboratory and field samples, and modeled the physicochemical properties of prymnesins. Aquatic toxicity to a model fish and cladoceran was reduced by lowering pH in samples obtained from reservoirs experiencing P. parvum blooms; similar observations were confirmed for experiments with laboratory cultures. A pKa value of 8.9 was predicted for the prymnesins, which suggests that ionization states of these toxins may change appreciably over surface water pH of inland waters. These findings indicate that ionization states of toxins released by P. parvum may strongly influence site-specific toxicity and subsequent impacts to fisheries. Consequently, these results emphasize the importance of understanding processes that affect pH during P. parvum blooms, which may improve predictions of ambient toxicity.

N2  - One of the key risk drivers at radioactive waste disposal facilities is radioiodine, especially 129I. As iodine mobility varies greatly with iodine speciation, experiments with 129I-contaminated aquifer sediments from the Savannah River Site located in Aiken, SC, were carried out to test iodine interactions with soils and aquifer sediments. Using tracer 125I- and stable 127I- additions, it was shown that such interactions were highly dependent on I- concentrations added to sediment suspensions, contact time with the sediment, and organic carbon (OC) content, resulting in an empirical particle-water partition coefficient (Kd) that was an inverse power function of the added I- concentration. However, Kd values of organically bound 127I were 3 orders of magnitude higher than those determined after 1-2 weeks of tracer equilibration, approaching those of OC. Under ambient conditions, organo-iodine (OI) was a major fraction (67%) of the total iodine in the dissolved phase and by implication of the particulate phase. As the total concentration of amended I- increased, the fraction of detectable dissolved OI decreased. This trend, attributed to OC becoming the limiting factor in the aquifer sediment explains why at elevated I-concentrations OI is often not detected.

N2  - Stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) were used to investigate feeding patterns of larval and early juvenile pelagic fishes in slope waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Contribution of organic matter supplied to fishes and trophic position within this pelagic food web was estimated in 2007 and 2008 by comparing dietary signatures of the two main producers in this ecosystem: phytoplankton [based on particulate organic matter (POM)] and Sargassum spp. Stable isotope ratios of POM and pelagic Sargassum spp. were significantly different from one another with delta13C values of POM depleted by 3-6 per thousand and delta15N values enriched by 2 relative to Sargassum spp. Stable isotope ratios were significantly different among the five pelagic fishes examined: blue marlin Makaira nigricans, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, pompano dolphinfish Coryphaena equiselis, sailfish Istiophorus platypterus and swordfish Xiphias gladius. Mean delta13C values ranged almost 2 among fishes and were most depleted in I. platypterus. In addition, mean delta15N values ranged 4-5 with highest mean values found for both C. hippurus and C. equiselis and the lowest mean value for M. nigricans during both years. Increasing delta13C or delta15N with standard length suggested that shifts in trophic position and diet occurred during early life for several species examined. Results of a two-source mixing model suggest approximately an equal contribution of organic matter by both sources (POM=55%; pelagic Sargassum spp.=45%) to the early life stages of pelagic fishes examined. Contribution of organic matter, however, varied among species, and sensitivity analyses indicated that organic source estimates changed from 2 to 13% for a delta(13)C fractionation change of +/-0.25 per thousand or a delta15N fractionation change of +/-1.0 per thousand relative to original fractionation values.

N2  - Eight different sewage treatment works were sampled in the North West of England. The effectiveness of the conventional treatment processes (primary sedimentation and biological trickling filters) as well as various tertiary treatment units in terms of both total and dissolved copper removal was evaluated. The removal of total copper across primary sedimentation averaged 53% and were relatively consistent at all sites, however, at three sites the removal of dissolved copper also occurred at this stage of treatment. Removal of total copper by the biological trickling filters averaged 49%, however, substantial dissolution of copper occurred at two sites, which highlighted the unpredictability of this treatment process in the removal of dissolved copper. Copper removal during tertiary treatment varied considerably even for the same treatment processes installed at different sites, primarily due to the variability of insoluble copper removal, with little effect on copper in the dissolved form being observed. The proportion of dissolved copper increased significantly during treatment, from an average of 22% in crude sewages to 55% in the final effluents. There may be the potential to optimise existing, conventional treatment processes (primary or biological treatment) to enhance dissolved copper removal, possibly reducing the requirement for installing any tertiary processes specifically for the removal of copper.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The use of antimicrobial solutions for irrigation in appendicitis is controversial. Numerous antiseptic and antibiotic solutions have been suggested for use as an intraoperative irrigant. We sought to determine whether there was a difference in postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) comparing normal saline (.9%), antiseptic solution (Dakin's, .25%), and an antibiotic solution (imipenem 1 mg/mL). METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of adult appendectomies from January 1997 through November 2007 at a single institution The data were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. The incidences of postoperative overall SSI, wound infection, and abdominal abscess were compared. RESULTS: A total of 1,063 cases were identified. Saline (n = 661) had an SSI rate of 9.8% (65/661), a wound infection rate of 7.3% (48/661), and an abdominal abscess rate of 4.2% (28/661). Dakin's (n = 208) had an SSI rate of 20.7% (43/208), a wound infection rate of 15.9% (33/208), and an abdominal abscess rate of 9.1% (19/208). Imipenem (n = 194) irrigation had an SSI rate of .5% (1/194), a wound infection rate of .5% (1/194), and an abdominal abscess rate of .5% (1/194). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that abdominal irrigation with an antibiotic solution (imipenem 1 mg/mL) is superior to both normal saline and Dakin's solution.

N2  - Natural bacterial communities are extremely diverse and highly dynamic, but evidence is mounting that the compositions of these communities follow predictable temporal patterns. We investigated these patterns with a 3-year, circumpolar study of bacterioplankton communities in the six largest rivers of the pan-arctic watershed (Ob', Yenisey, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie), five of which are among Earth's 25 largest rivers. Communities in the six rivers shifted synchronously over time, correlating with seasonal shifts in hydrology and biogeochemistry and clustering into three groups: winter/spring, spring freshet, and summer/fall. This synchrony indicates that hemisphere-scale variation in seasonal climate sets the pace of variation in microbial diversity. Moreover, these seasonal communities reassembled each year in all six rivers, suggesting a long-term, predictable succession in the composition of big river bacterioplankton communities.

N2  - Cetaceans are thought to display a diversity of feeding modes that are often described as convergent with other more basal aquatic vertebrates (i.e. actinopterygians). However, the biomechanics of feeding in cetaceans has been relatively ignored by functional biologists. This study investigated the feeding behavior, kinematics and pressure generation of three odontocetes with varying feeding modes (belugas, Delphinapterus leucas; Pacific white-sided dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens; and long-finned pilot whales, Globicephala melas). Four feeding phases were recognized in all odontocetes: (I) preparatory, (II) jaw opening, (III) gular depression, and (IV) jaw closing. Belugas relied on a feeding mode that was composed of discrete ram and suction components. Pacific white-sided dolphins fed using ram, with some suction for compensation or manipulation of prey. Pilot whales were kinematically similar to belugas but relied on a combination of ram and suction that was less discrete than belugas. Belugas were able to purse the anterior lips to occlude lateral gape and form a small, circular anterior aperture that is convergent with feeding behaviors observed in more basal vertebrates. Suction generation in odontocetes is a function of hyolingual displacement and rapid jaw opening, and is likely to be significantly enhanced by lip pursing behaviors. Some degree of subambient pressure was measured in all species, with belugas reaching 126 kPa. Functional variations of suction generation during feeding demonstrate a wider diversity of feeding behaviors in odontocetes than previously thought. However, odontocete suction generation is convergent with that of more basal aquatic vertebrates.

N2  - As highly mobile marine predators, many pinniped species routinely encounter a wide range of water temperatures during foraging and in association with seasonal, geographical and climatic changes. To determine how such variation in environmental temperature may impact energetic costs in otariids, we determined the thermal neutral zone of adult and juvenile California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) by measuring resting metabolic rate using open-flow respirometry. Five adult female (body mass range =82.2-107.2 kg) and four juvenile (body mass=26.2-36.5 kg) sea lions were examined over experimental water temperatures ranging from 0 to 20 degrees C (adults) or 5 to 20 degrees C (juveniles). The metabolic rate of adult sea lions averaged 6.4+/-0.64 ml O(2) kg(-1) min(-1) when resting within the thermal neutral zone. The lower critical temperature of adults was 6.4+/-2.2 degrees C, approximately 4 degrees C lower than sea surface temperatures routinely encountered off coastal California. In comparison, juvenile sea lions did not demonstrate thermal neutrality within the range of water temperatures examined. Resting metabolic rate of the younger animals, 6.3+/-0.53 ml O(2) kg(-1) min(-1), increased as water temperature approached 12 degrees C, and suggested a potential thermal limitation in the wild. To determine whether muscle thermogenesis during activity could mitigate this limitation, we measured the active metabolic rate of juveniles swimming at water temperature (T(water))=5, 12 and 20 degrees C. No significant difference (F=0.377, P=0.583) in swimming metabolic rate was found among water temperatures, suggesting that thermal disadvantages due to small body size in juvenile sea lions may be circumvented by recycling endogenous heat during locomotor activity.

N2  - High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) is a highly sensitive closed-tube genotyping method used primarily in clinical studies. As the method is rapid, inexpensive and amenable to high throughput, we decided to investigate its applicability to population studies. Small amplicons and unlabelled probes were used to genotype the nuclear genes, lactate dehydrogenase-A (ldh-A), myosin light chain-2 (mlc-2), acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (ARP) and calmodulin (CaM) in populations of swordfish, Xiphias gladius. Results indicate that HRMA is a powerful genotyping tool to study wild populations.

N2  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The rapid growth of the Latino population in the U.S. over the past 15 years has led to a significant increase in levels of primary and secondary school enrollment rates of Latino children. Research on Latino education has demonstrated the institutional and contextual challenges faced by this increasingly significant group, but studies that link Latino representation and Latino educational performance have neglected to sort out the direct and indirect effects of representation on student achievement. The central assumption in these studies outlines a causal chain running from Latino political representation (school boards), to Latino bureaucratic representation (administrators and teachers), to Latino student performance. This study tests these theoretical assumptions by employing a path analytic model using data from 1,040 Texas school districts for the years 1997–2001 to tease out the direct and indirect effects of Latino representation on Latino student achievement. We find robust evidence of the impact of Latino political representation on Latino educational attainment in Texas, operating via a direct effect on the number of Latino administrators and teachers and an indirect effect on Latino student performance. Additionally, our results demonstrate that descriptive representation becomes substantive representation in the area of education policy for Latinos and that this relationship remains strong over time. These findings underscore the importance of school board elections and school district hiring practices on Latino student performance.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Low enrollment and high attrition rates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) based degree programs have created a shortage of workforce in industries such as shipbuilding and repair that are important for national security. Part of this problem can be attributed to pedagogical issues such as lack of engaging hands-on activities used for math and science instruction in middle and high schools. Another reason for this is that the teachers are not trained in taking an integrated approach to teaching math and science. This has led to large-scale flight and attrition from STEM-based career tracks. Consequently, engineering and engineering technology programs throughout the nation have observed declining graduation rates and quality of incoming students. To engage students' interest in STEM-based careers, it is important that students establish a link between the math and science instruction and its application to solve real-life problems early in their learning experience. Project-based activities have a proven record as a pedagogical method. Effectiveness of this pedagogy has been supported by research in the acquisition and retention of knowledge. The MarineTech Project funded by the State Council of Higher Education of Virginia and supported by the shipbuilding and repair industry has attempted to address the quality of STEM education in Virginia by developing project-based learning kits and providing professional development training in the use of these kits. The project also provided teacher training in 21st century skills and integrated math and science education while increasing awareness of teachers about the shipbuilding and repair industry. The paper presents the motivation behind developing these project-based learning (PBL) modules, issues related to implementation, and results from student and teacher workshops.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p> Territory quality and site fidelity were assessed for male sea otters ( Enhydra lutris (L., 1758)) in Simpson Bay, Prince William Sound, Alaska, during the summer months (May–August) from 2003 to 2006. Territory quality was coded with a score of 0–2 for four attributes: territory size, shoreline enclosure, territory accessibility, and number of females observed feeding in each territory. Total quality scores ranged from 0.14 to 1.96 (0.9 ± 0.61, mean ± SD), with the highest quality territories having large areas, moderate to little shoreline enclosure, high accessibility, and many foraging females. A total of 13.1 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (62.5%) of Simpson Bay was occupied at least once by a territorial male during the 4-year study, and 7.9 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (37.5%) was never occupied by a territorial male. There were 7 ± 2.4 (mean ± SD) territorial males in Simpson Bay each year. Five males maintained territories for two consecutive years, with their respective territories having a 16%–34% overlap between years, indicating that repeat territory holders returned to the same area. The number of territorial sea otters, the size of territories, and whether or not a sea otter was a repeat territory holder did not significantly influence the size or quality of male territories. </jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p> Increased knowledge of stock mixing and migration of Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ) is required to properly manage and conserve declining populations. Here, we predicted the nursery origin of giant bluefin tuna (n = 224) present in samples from Canadian waters using stable δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C and δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O isotopes in otoliths. The isotopic composition of milled otolith cores (corresponding to the first year of life) of giant bluefin tuna from three decades (1970s, 1980s, 2000s) and three regions within or adjacent to the Gulf of St. Lawrence was compared with otolith δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C and δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O of yearling bluefin tuna collected from eastern (Mediterranean Sea – eastern Atlantic, n = 136) and western (western Atlantic, n = 103) nurseries. Maximum likelihood estimates indicated that greater than 99% of bluefin tuna in our Canadian samples originated from the western nursery. No significant differences in estimates of origin for bluefin tuna were detected among decades or among regions, suggesting little to no mixing of eastern and western populations in the Canadian samples examined. These findings justify the use of catch rates from the Gulf of St. Lawrence area as an index of abundance for the oldest members of the western population. </jats:p>

N2  - Low water oxygen content (hypoxia) is a common feature of many freshwater and marine environments. However, we have a poor understanding of the degree to which diminished cardiac function contributes to the reduction in fish swimming performance concomitant with acute exposure to hypoxia, or how fish cardiorespiratory physiology is altered by, or adapts to, chronic hypoxia. Thus, we acclimated adult Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to either approximately 8-9 kPa O(2) (40-45% air saturation) or approximately 21 kPa O(2) (100% air saturation; normoxia) for 6-12 weeks at 10 degrees C, and subsequently measured metabolic variables [routine oxygen consumption (M(O(2)), maximum (M(O(2)), metabolic scope] and cardiac function (cardiac output, Q; heart rate, f(H); and stroke volume, V(S)) in these fish during critical swimming speed (U(crit)) tests performed at both levels of water oxygenation. Although surgery (flow probe implantation) reduced the U(crit) of normoxia-acclimated cod by 14% (from 1.74 to 1.50 BL s(-1)) under normoxic conditions, exposure to acute hypoxia lowered the U(crit) of both groups (surgery and non-surgery) by approximately 30% (to 1.23 and 1.02 BL s(-1), respectively). This reduction in swimming performance was associated with large decreases in maximum M(O(2)) and metabolic scope (> or = 50%), and maximum f(H) and Q (by 16 and 22%), but not V(S). Long-term acclimation to hypoxia resulted in a significant elevation in normoxic metabolic rate as compared with normoxia-acclimated fish (by 27%), but did not influence normoxic or hypoxic values for U(crit), maximum M(O(2)) or metabolic scope. This was surprising given that resting and maximum values for Q were significantly lower in hypoxia-acclimated cod at both levels of oxygenation, because of lower values for V(S). However, hypoxia-acclimated cod were able to consume more oxygen for a given cardiac output. These results provide important insights into how fish cardiorespiratory physiology is impacted by short-term and prolonged exposure to hypoxia, and further highlight the tremendous capacity of the fish cardiorespiratory system to deal with environmental challenges.

N2  - Recent in vivo experiments on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) acclimated to chronic hypoxia (6-12 weeks at 10 degrees C; Pw(O(2)) approximately 8-9 kPa) revealed a considerable decrease in the pumping capacity of the heart. To examine whether this diminished cardiac performance was due to the direct effects of chronic moderate hypoxia on the myocardium (as opposed to alterations in neural and/or hormonal control), we measured the resting and maximum in situ function of hearts from normoxia- and hypoxia-acclimated cod: (1) when initially perfused with oxygenated saline; (2) at the end of a 15 min exposure to severe hypoxia (P(O(2)) approximately 0.6 kPa); and (3) 30 min after the hearts had been reperfused with oxygenated saline. Acclimation to hypoxia did not influence resting (basal) in situ cardiac performance during oxygenated or hypoxic conditions. However, it caused a decrease in maximum cardiac output (Q(max)) under oxygenated conditions (from 49.5 to 40.3 ml min(-1) kg(-1); by 19%), that was due to diminished values for maximum stroke volume (V(S)) and scope for V(S). Severe hypoxia reduced in both groups to approximately 20 ml min(-1) kg(-1), yet, the hearts of hypoxia-acclimated fish were better able to sustain this level of Q under hypoxia, and the recovery of Q(max) (as compared with initial values under oxygenated conditions) was significantly improved (94% vs 83%). These data show that acclimation to hypoxia has a direct effect on cod myocardial function and/or physiology, and suggest that the cod heart shows some adaptations to prolonged hypoxia.

N2  - Unaccounted sources of contamination can be problematic in toxicological studies and can range from the presence of impurities, breakdown products or isoforms of the parent compound to the unexpected compounds leaching from dosing apparatus. As these compounds are not being tested, they may not be measured in the dosed aquaria and hence go undetected, potentially contributing as confounding factors in toxicological assessments. In this paper we report the unexpected detection of butyltin compounds (mono, di and tributyltin) in flow-through aquaria waters of an aquatic toxicological set-up. High and variable leaching rates for dibutyltin of 2.0 and 6.6 microg/h were detected during the first week of each of two separate flow-through studies. Following this initial 'surge' of dibutyltin leachate, a decrease in leachate rate was seen with values of 0.9 and 1.2 microg/h by Day 14 (second week of study). The main source of the butyltin leachates was shown, to be the airline tubing used in the assembly of the air-supply into each flow-through tank. A 24h period of incubation of the airline tubing with clean water led to the leaching of concentrations of 63.8 ng/l TBT-Sn, 1638.8 ng/l DBT-Sn and 4054.6 ng/l MBT-Sn. The concentration of tributyltin detected was within its toxicologically effective range and as such could have potentially confounding effects on the toxicological bioassays being used. These accidental findings could be of enormous relevance to aquatic toxicologists and have an important bearing on the choice of materials used to construct experimental exposure aquaria.

N2  - Recent studies have shown that many persistent organic pollutants (POPs, e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and various pesticides), are strongly associated with carbonaceous materials (including organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC)). We hypothesize that carbonaceous materials can be used as a first-order pollution index, to indicate areas where POP pollution may require further investigation. We tested our hypothesis and found that strong, positive correlations between BC and OC contents versus the concentrations of PCBs (and PAHs) existed in estuarine sediments of the Danshui River in 2005 and 2008. Thus, our preliminary results demonstrate that POC and BC are potential indicators of the POP pollution potential in fluvial sediments of the Danshui River in Taiwan. This innovative approach can provide a simple, relatively inexpensive and expedient means to monitor concentrations of POPs in polluted aquatic sediments of Taiwan, and/or those having a legacy of POP inputs.

N2  - Low abundant (<100 cells mL(-1)) E. coli O157:H7 cells were isolated and enriched from environmental water samples using a microfluidic chip. The poly(methylmethacrylate), PMMA, chip contained 8 devices, each equipped with 16 curvilinear high aspect ratio channels that were covalently decorated with polyclonal anti-O157 antibodies (pAb) and could search for rare cells through a pAb mediated process. The chip could process independently 8 different samples or one sample using 8 different parallel inputs to increase volume processing throughput. After cell enrichment, cells were released and enumerated using benchtop real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), targeting genes which effectively discriminated the O157:H7 serotype from other nonpathogenic bacteria. The recovery of target cells from water samples was determined to be approximately 72%, and the limit-of-detection was found to be 6 colony forming units (cfu) using the slt1 gene as a reporter. We subsequently performed analysis of lake and wastewater samples. The simplicity in manufacturing and ease of operation makes this device attractive for the selection of pathogenic species from a variety of water supplies suspected of containing bacterial pathogens at extremely low frequencies.

N2  - <jats:p> Stable isotopes are important tools for understanding the trophic roles of elasmobranchs. However, whether different tissues provide consistent stable isotope values within an individual are largely unknown. To address this, the relationships among carbon and nitrogen isotope values were quantified for blood, muscle, and fin from juvenile bull sharks ( Carcharhinus leucas ) and blood and fin from large tiger sharks ( Galeocerdo cuvier ) collected in two different ecosystems. We also investigated the relationship between shark size and the magnitude of differences in isotopic values between tissues. Isotope values were significantly positively correlated for all paired tissue comparisons, but R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> values were much higher for δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C than for δ<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N. Paired differences between isotopic values of tissues were relatively small but varied significantly with shark total length, suggesting that shark size can be an important factor influencing the magnitude of differences in isotope values of different tissues. For studies of juvenile sharks, care should be taken in using slow turnover tissues like muscle and fin, because they may retain a maternal signature for an extended time. Although correlations were relatively strong, results suggest that correction factors should be generated for the desired study species and may only allow coarse-scale comparisons between studies using different tissue types. </jats:p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Genes involved in immune functions, including pathogen recognition and the activation of innate defense pathways, are among the most genetically variable known, and the proteins that they encode are often characterized by high rates of amino acid substitutions, a hallmark of positive selection. The high levels of variation characteristic of immunity genes make them useful tools for conservation genetics. To date, highly variable immunity genes have yet to be found in corals, keystone organisms of the world's most diverse marine ecosystem, the coral reef. Here, we examine variation in and selection on a putative innate immunity gene from Oculina, a coral genus previously used as a model for studies of coral disease and bleaching. RESULTS: In a survey of 244 Oculina alleles, we find high nonsynonymous variation and a signature of positive selection, consistent with a putative role in immunity. Using computational protein structure prediction, we generate a structural model of the Oculina protein that closely matches the known structure of tachylectin-2 from the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus), a protein with demonstrated function in microbial recognition and agglutination. We also demonstrate that at least three other genera of anthozoan cnidarians (Acropora, Montastrea and Nematostella) possess proteins structurally similar to tachylectin-2. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the evidence of high amino acid diversity, positive selection and structural correspondence to the horseshoe crab tachylectin-2 suggests that this protein is 1) part of Oculina's innate immunity repertoire, and 2) evolving adaptively, possibly under selective pressure from coral-associated microorganisms. Tachylectin-2 may serve as a candidate locus to screen coral populations for their capacity to respond adaptively to future environmental change.

N2  - Mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data should recover historical demographic events at different temporal scales due to differences in their effective population sizes and substitution rates. This expectation was tested for two closely related coral reef fish, the tube blennies Acanthemblemaria aspera and A. spinosa. These two have similar life histories and dispersal potentials, and co-occur throughout the Caribbean. Sequence data for one mitochondrial and two nuclear markers were collected for 168 individuals across the species' Caribbean ranges. Although both species shared a similar pattern of genetic subdivision, A. spinosa had 20-25 times greater nucleotide sequence divergence among populations than A. aspera at all three markers. Substitution rates estimated using a relaxed clock approach revealed that mitochondrial COI is evolving at 11.2% pairwise sequence divergence per million years. This rapid mitochondrial rate had obscured the signal of old population expansions for both species, which were only recovered using the more slowly evolving nuclear markers. However, the rapid COI rate allowed the recovery of a recent expansion in A. aspera corresponding to a period of increased habitat availability. Only by combining both nuclear and mitochondrial data were we able to recover the complex demographic history of these fish.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Lysozymes are enzymes that lyse bacterial cell walls, an activity widely used for host defense but also modified in some instances for digestion. The biochemical and evolutionary changes between these different functional forms has been well-studied in the c-type lysozymes of vertebrates, but less so in the i-type lysozymes prevalent in most invertebrate animals. Some bivalve molluscs possess both defensive and digestive lysozymes. RESULTS: We report a third lysozyme from the oyster Crassostrea virginica, cv-lysozyme 3. The chemical properties of cv-lysozyme 3 (including molecular weight, isoelectric point, basic amino acid residue number, and predicted protease cutting sites) suggest it represents a transitional form between lysozymes used for digestion and immunity. The cv-lysozyme 3 protein inhibited the growth of bacteria (consistent with a defensive function), but semi-quantitative RT-PCR suggested the gene was expressed mainly in digestive glands. Purified cv-lysozyme 3 expressed maximum muramidase activity within a range of pH (7.0 and 8.0) and ionic strength (I = 0.005-0.01) unfavorable for either cv-lysozyme 1 or cv-lysozyme 2 activities. The topology of a phylogenetic analysis of cv-lysozyme 3 cDNA (full length 663 bp, encoding an open reading frame of 187 amino acids) is also consistent with a transitional condition, as cv-lysozyme 3 falls at the base of a monophyletic clade of bivalve lysozymes identified from digestive glands. Rates of nonsynonymous substitution are significantly high at the base of this clade, consistent with an episode of positive selection associated with the functional transition from defense to digestion. CONCLUSION: The pattern of molecular evolution accompanying the shift from defensive to digestive function in the i-type lysozymes of bivalves parallels those seen for c-type lysozymes in mammals and suggests that the lysozyme paralogs that enhance the range of physiological conditions for lysozyme activity may provide stepping stones between defensive and digestive forms.

N2  - Monitoring natural waters for the inadvertent release of radioactive fission products produced as a result of nuclear power generation downstream from these facilities is essential for maintaining water quality. To this end, we evaluated sorbents for simultaneous in-situ large volume extraction of radionuclides with both soft (e.g., Ag) and hard metal (e.g., Co, Zr, Nb, Ba, and Cs) or anionic (e.g., Ru, Te, Sb) character. In this study, we evaluated a number of conventional and novel nanoporous sorbents in both fresh and salt waters. In most cases, the nanoporous sorbents demonstrated enhanced retention of analytes. Salinity had significant effects upon sorbent performance and was most significant for hard cations, specifically Cs and Ba. The presence of natural organic matter had little effect on the ability of chemisorbents to extract target elements.

N2  - <jats:p> The metabolic process of steroidogenesis exhibits a complex biochemical network topology as the activity of various steroidogenic enzymes control cholesterol metabolism to steroid hormone derivatives. In this paper, a stoichiometric reconstruction of a sub-set of 65 reactions from the zebrafish (Danio rerio) steroidogenic network is presented and simulated using uniform reaction constraints. The reconstruction defined a set of 65 enzyme catalyzed reactions and 37 exchange or transport reactions for steroid metabolites. The reconstructed reactions were inclusive of cholesterol and androgen/estrogen metabolism. Biased (statement of network objective function) and un-biased (no statement of objective function) analyses were applied to identify network properties dependent on reaction stoichiometry. Random sampling of flux distributions through the network identified highly-correlated reaction sets that corresponded to the catalysis of steroid metabolites of physiological relevance. Subsequently, optimal flux distributions through network pathways were determined for the production of the three steroidogenic metabolites of: 11-deoxycorticosterone, testosterone and 17β-estradiol. Furthermore, flux variability analyses revealed and confirmed optimal network fluxes through physiologically feasible pathways. The stoichiometric dependence of reactions was also confirmed by conducting deletions of reactions utilized for the optimal production of 17β-estradiol. This paper demonstrates the potential application of constraint-based reconstruction and simulation techniques in enabling the construction of deterministic and predictive physiological models. This acknowledgement is poignant considering the susceptibility of the steroidogenic network to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. </jats:p>

N2  - Biomineralization has mostly been studied in the class Anthozoa (Phylum Cnidaria), but very little is known about the evolution of the calcified skeleton in the class Hydrozoa or about the processes leading to its formation. The evolution of the calcified skeleton is here investigated in the hydrozoan family Hydractiniidae. A phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal, mitochondrial, and nuclear-protein-coding DNA sequences supported two independent origins of the calcified skeleton within the Hydractiniidae and indicates a case of parallel evolution, as suspected in the Anthozoa. Neither of the two origins of skeleton in the Hydractiniidae has led to either speciose or numerically abundant species, in contrast with other skeletonized hydrozoan families. Finally, we show that the origin of calcified skeletons in the Hydractiniidae is significantly correlated with the distribution of species with calcium carbonate granules within a polyp's gastrodermal cells. This suggests that the presence of these granules precedes the origin of a full skeleton.

Genetic differentiation between eastern and western Mediterranean swordfish revealed by phylogeographic analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1222–1229. Despite there being evidence of several discrete breeding grounds, Mediterranean populations of swordfish have been considered a single panmictic unit with no genetic substructure. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region of five Mediterranean locations (n = 251) reveals for the first time a clear genetic differentiation between eastern and western Mediterranean populations. This differentiation was detected only after conducting separate phylogeographic analyses on two previously described mtDNA clades. Although the frequencies of these clades are similar throughout the Mediterranean Sea, the levels of intra-clade genetic variation drop substantially towards the eastern end. This, together with clear differences in past demographic history and uneven migration rates between Mediterranean basins, suggests that the two populations experienced different effects during the Pleistocene. Subsequently, the mtDNA distinctiveness of eastern and western Mediterranean swordfish populations has been maintained probably by homing towards breeding areas.</jats:p>

N2  - 1. Apex predators are often assumed to be dietary generalists and, by feeding on prey from multiple basal nutrient sources, serve to couple discrete food webs. But there is increasing evidence that individual level dietary specialization may be common in many species, and this has not been investigated for many marine apex predators. 2. Because of their position at or near the top of many marine food webs, and the possibility that they can affect populations of their prey and induce trophic cascades, it is important to understand patterns of dietary specialization in shark populations. 3. Stable isotope values from body tissues with different turnover rates were used to quantify patterns of individual specialization in two species of 'generalist' sharks (bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, and tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier). 4. Despite wide population-level isotopic niche breadths in both species, isotopic values of individual tiger sharks varied across tissues with different turnover rates. The population niche breadth was explained mostly by variation within individuals suggesting tiger sharks are true generalists. In contrast, isotope values of individual bull sharks were stable through time and their wide population level niche breadth was explained by variation among specialist individuals. 5. Relative resource abundance and spatial variation in food-predation risk tradeoffs may explain the differences in patterns of specialization between shark species. 6. The differences in individual dietary specialization between tiger sharks and bull sharks results in different functional roles in coupling or compartmentalizing distinct food webs. 7. Individual specialization may be an important feature of trophic dynamics of highly mobile marine top predators and should be explicitly considered in studies of marine food webs and the ecological role of top predators.

In order to better understand the seasonal patterns of nutrient loadings from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, nutrient mass balance analyses were performed for the Mississippi River system to separate the effects of primary tributary inputs from in-channel processes. Our results showed that seasonal changes in dissolved inorganic nutrients resulted from conservative mixing of primary tributaries. Maximal values of nitrate plus nitrite (NO3+2) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) fluxes during May through July were largely attributed to inputs from the upper Mississippi River (UMR), which was highest in NO3+2 and SRP levels and contributed more water during this period. Mass balances also showed net losses of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus (29% and 18%, respectively), with the highest values occurring during the falling stage. We speculate that one possible reason was retention of coarse suspended sediments that were mainly derived from the Missouri River. The loss of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus was also apparent (∼12% and 20%, respectively), and the largest loss occurred during summer. This study highlights the importance of divergent processes in controlling different forms of nutrients in large rivers.

N2  - <jats:p>In altricial mammals, mothers' care and attendance are essential for young to acquire survival skills. Despite the crucial importance of this early period for pup survival, not much is known about mother–pup behaviour and time allocation in the wild. To improve our understanding of the critical period of the sea otter development, a total of 240 30-minute focal follows of females with pups of different ages were conducted in four 6-hour-periods (dawn, day, dusk and night) from 4 June to 12 August 2008. Generalized linear models were used to investigate the impact of age, weather, tide and time of day on otters' behaviour. Pups significantly decreased resting behaviour and increased feeding, travelling, interacting and grooming behaviour with increasing age. Females with large pups fed and interacted significantly more, and travelled and groomed the pup less than females with small pups. Foggy conditions were associated with less resting on the water and increased travelling by pups. Tide did not appear to have an effect on sea otter behaviour. Grooming by pups occurred mainly during dawn in medium sized pups whereas large pups groomed themselves mostly during the day and night. Variations due to times of day tended to be apparent only in larger, i.e. older pups. Females and large pups were more active during the day. Mothers of smaller pups spent most of their active time travelling whereas females with large pups were mostly feeding. This study showed how sea otter females with pups adapted their behaviours as their pups grew and matured during the first months of life.</jats:p>

N2  - It is now widely recognized that dissolution plays an important role in metallic nanoparticle toxicity, but to what extent remains unclear. In the present study, it was found that ZnO-engineered nanoparticle (ZnO-EN) toxicity to the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana could be solely explained by zinc ion (Zn(2+) ) release. This is based on comparable inhibitive effects from ZnO-EN addition media, with or without the ultrafiltration through a 3-kD membrane, and from the media in which only Zn(2+) was added. Considering the importance of dissolution in ZnO-EN toxicity, Zn(2+) release kinetics was systematically examined under different conditions for the first time. It was found to be mainly influenced by pH as well as the specific surface area of the nanoparticles. In contrast, natural organic compounds either enhance or reduce Zn(2+) release, depending on their chemical composition and concentration. Compared with deionized water, ZnO-EN dissolution rates were accelerated in seawater, whereas ZnO-EN concentration itself only had a very small effect on Zn(2+) release. Therefore, dissolution as affected by several physicochemical factors should not be neglected in the effects, behavior, and fate of ENs in the environment.

               <jats:p>New equilibrium and kinetic models have been developed to describe rate-limited sorption and desorption of Pu onto and off of mineral oxide surfaces using a generic approach to estimate sorption constants that require minimal laboratory calibrations. Equilibrium reactions describing a total of six surface species were derived from a combination of empirical relationships previously described in the literature and generated as part of this work. These sorption reactions and corresponding equilibrium constants onto goethite (and silica) are:</jats:p>

N2  - In aquatic environments, iodine mainly exists as iodide, iodate, and organic iodine. The high mobility of iodine in aquatic systems has led to (129)I contamination problems at sites where nuclear fuel has been reprocessed, such as the F-area of Savannah River Site. In order to assess the distribution of (129)I and stable (127)I in environmental systems, a sensitive and rapid method was developed which enables determination of isotopic ratios of speciated iodine. Iodide concentrations were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatization to 4-iodo-N,N-dimethylaniline. Iodate concentrations were quantified by measuring the difference of iodide concentrations in the solution before and after reduction by Na(2)S(2)O(5). Total iodine, including inorganic and organic iodine, was determined after conversion to iodate by combustion at 900 °C. Organo-iodine was calculated as the difference between the total iodine and total inorganic iodine (iodide and iodate). The detection limits of iodide-127 and iodate-127 were 0.34 nM and 1.11 nM, respectively, whereas the detection limits for both iodide-129 and iodate-129 was 0.08 nM (i.e., 2pCi (129)I/L). This method was successfully applied to water samples from the contaminated Savannah River Site, South Carolina, and more pristine Galveston Bay, Texas.

N2  - The behavior and toxicity of silver engineered nanoparticles (Ag-ENs) to the mixotrophic freshwater alga Ochromonas danica were examined in the present study to determine whether any other mechanisms are involved in their algal toxicity besides Ag(+) liberation outside the cells. Despite their good dispersability, the Ag-ENs were found to continuously aggregate and dissolve rapidly. When the initial nanoparticle concentration was lower than 10 µM, the total dissolved Ag(+) concentration ([Ag(+)](T)) in the suspending media reached its maximum after 1 d and then decreased suggesting that Ag(+) release might be limited by the nanoparticle surface area under these conditions. Furthermore, Ag-EN dissolution extent remarkably increased in the presence of glutathione. In the Ag-EN toxicity experiment, glutathione was also used to eliminate the indirect effects of Ag(+) that was released. However, remarkable toxicity was still observed although the free Ag(+) concentration in the media was orders of magnitude lower than the non-observed effect concentration of Ag(+) itself. Such inhibitive effects were mitigated when more glutathione was added, but could never be completely eliminated. Most importantly, we demonstrate, for the first time, that Ag-ENs can be taken in and accumulated inside the algal cells, where they exerted their toxic effects. Therefore, nanoparticle internalization may be an alternative pathway through which algal growth can be influenced.

N2  - Previous research has shown that hypoxia-acclimated Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) have significantly reduced cardiac function but can consume more oxygen for a given cardiac output (Q). However, it is not known (1) which physiological changes permit a greater "oxygen pulse" (oxygen consumed per mL of blood pumped) in hypoxia-acclimated individuals or (2) whether chronic exposure to low-oxygen conditions improves the hypoxia tolerance of cod. Thus, we exposed normoxia- and hypoxia-acclimated (> 6 wk at a water oxygen partial pressure [P(w)O(2)] ~8-9 kPa) cod to a graded normoxia challenge until loss of equilibrium occurred while recording the following cardiorespiratory variables: oxygen consumption (MO(2)), ventilatory rate, cardiac function (Q, heart rate f(H), and stroke volume S(V)), ventral aortic blood pressure (P(VA)), venous oxygen partial pressure (P(v)O(2)) and oxygen content (C(v)O(2)), plasma catecholamines, and blood hemoglobin ([Hb]) and hematocrit (Hct). In addition, we performed in vitro hemoglobin oxygen binding curves to examine whether hypoxia acclimation influences hemoglobin functional properties. Numerous physiological adjustments occurred in vivo during the > 6 wk of hypoxia acclimation: that is, increased f(H), decreased S(V) and Q, elevated [Hb], enhanced tissue oxygen extraction (by 10% at a P(w)O(2) of 20 kPa), and a more robust stress response as evidenced by circulating catecholamine levels that were two to eight times higher when fish were acutely exposed to severe hypoxia. In contrast, chronic hypoxia had no significant effect on the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, on in vitro hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity, or on the cod's hypoxia tolerance (H(crit); the P(w)O(2) at which the fish lost equilibrium, which was 4.3 ± 0.2 and 4.8 ± 0.3 kPa in normoxia- and hypoxia-acclimated fish, respectively). These data suggest that while chronic hypoxia results in numerous physiological adjustments, these changes do not improve the cod's capacity to tolerate low-oxygen conditions.

N2  - Reconstructions of 250 years historical inputs of two distinct types of black carbon (soot/graphitic black carbon (GBC) and char-BC) were conducted on sediment cores from two basins of the Puget Sound, WA. Signatures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also used to support the historical reconstructions of BC to this system. Down-core maxima in GBC and combustion-derived PAHs occurred in the 1940s in the cores from the Puget Sound Main Basin, whereas in Hood Canal such peak was observed in the 1970s, showing basin-specific differences in inputs of combustion byproducts. This system showed relatively higher inputs from softwood combustion than the northeastern U.S. The historical variations in char-BC concentrations were consistent with shifts in climate indices, suggesting an influence of climate oscillations on wildfire events. Environmental loading of combustion byproducts thus appears as a complex function of urbanization, fuel usage, combustion technology, environmental policies, and climate conditions.

N2  - Field and laboratory studies were carried out to understand the cause for steady increases in (129)I concentrations emanating from radiological basins located on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina. The basins were closed in 1988 by adding limestone and slag and then capping with a low permeability engineered cover. Groundwater (129)I concentrations in a well near the basins in 1993 were 200 pCi L(-1) and are presently between 400 and 1000 pCi L(-1). Iodine speciation in the plume contained wide ranges of iodide, iodate, and organo-iodine concentrations. First-order calculations based on a basin sediment desorption study indicate that the modest increase of 0.7 pH units detected in the study site groundwater over the last 17 years since closure of the basins may be sufficient to produce the observed increased groundwater (129)I concentrations near the basins. Groundwater monitoring of the plume at the basins has shown that the migration of many of the high risk radionuclides originally present at this complex site has been attenuated. However, (129)I continues to leave the source at a rate that may have been exacerbated by the initial remediation efforts. This study underscores the importance of identifying the appropriate in situ stabilization technologies for all source contaminants, especially if their geochemical behaviors differ.

N2  - The elemental composition of phytoplankton is a fusion of the evolutionary history of the host and plastid, resulting in differences in genetic constraints and selection pressures associated with environmental conditions. The evolutionary inheritance hypothesis predicts similarities in elemental composition within related taxonomic lineages of phytoplankton. To test this hypothesis, we measured the elemental composition (C, N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cd and Mo) of 14 phytoplankton species and combined these with published data from 15 more species from both marine and freshwater environments grown under nutrient-replete conditions. The largest differences in the elemental profiles of the species distinguish between the prokaryotic Cyanophyta and primary endosymbiotic events that resulted in the green and red plastid lineages. Smaller differences in trace element stoichiometry within the red and green plastid lineages are consistent with changes in trace elemental stoichiometry owing to the processes associated with secondary endosymbioses and inheritance by descent with modification.

The yields of smooth, defect-free mesas were ~ 17% for both intentionally and unintentionally doped films, while those with screw dislocations and multiple stepped surfaces were ~ 22%. The electronic and structural properties of the mesas were found on a micrometer-sized length scale using µ-PL and µ-Raman, respectively. 3C-SiC mesas were found to have complete 3C-SiC coverage with some of the mesas having electronic defects, while other mesas were found to be defect-free.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>The growth of epitaxial graphene on C-face 6H-SiC substrates is investigated using pro-cess conditions that can form small, local areas of graphene. The thickness of SiC lost to Si sublimation is not completely countered by the thickness of the resulting graphene and so graphene-covered basins (GCBs) are formed. The GCBs are most likely nucleated at threading dislocations from the substrate. The GCB morphology exhibits ridges, similar to those found on continuous films. The GCBs expand through erosion of the surrounding SiC substrate walls, eventually coalescing into continuous films. The ratio of the Raman D and G peaks was used to estimate the crystallite length scale and it was found to be about 200 nm for small GCBs and &gt; 1 m for continuous films.</jats:p>

N2  - (129)I is of major concern because of its mobility in the environment, excessive inventory, toxicity (it accumulates in the thyroid), and long half-life (∼16 million years). The aim of this study was to determine if bacteria from a (129)I-contaminated oxic aquifer at the F area of the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site, SC, could accumulate iodide at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1 μM I(-)). Iodide accumulation capability was found in 3 out of 136 aerobic bacterial strains isolated from the F area that were closely related to Streptomyces/Kitasatospora spp., Bacillus mycoides, and Ralstonia/Cupriavidus spp. Two previously described iodide-accumulating marine strains, a Flexibacter aggregans strain and an Arenibacter troitsensis strain, accumulated 2 to 50% total iodide (0.1 μM), whereas the F-area strains accumulated just 0.2 to 2.0%. Iodide accumulation by FA-30 was stimulated by the addition of H(2)O(2), was not inhibited by chloride ions (27 mM), did not exhibit substrate saturation kinetics with regard to I(-) concentration (up to 10 μM I(-)), and increased at pH values of <6. Overall, the data indicate that I(-) accumulation likely results from electrophilic substitution of cellular organic molecules. This study demonstrates that readily culturable, aerobic bacteria of the F-area aquifer do not accumulate significant amounts of iodide; however, this mechanism may contribute to the long-term fate and transport of (129)I and to the biogeochemical cycling of iodine over geologic time.

N2  - Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) comprise a species-of-choice for the hazard assessments of various environmental contaminants, including compounds capable of disrupting endocrine function. Towards this end, the use of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and/or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is gaining common use for the quantification of steroid hormones as biomarkers of endocrine stress in small-fish toxicological studies. In this work, 2-hydrazinopyridine (2-HP) was used to derivatize and quantify the physiologically relevant steroid hormones of: 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone, 11-ketotestosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and 17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone, in the blood plasma of male and female fathead minnows. Liquid chromatographic separation was achieved using a Waters™ Sunfire C(18) column (2.1 mm×50 mm with a 3.5 μm particle size) and Milli-Q water:methanol (both with 0.1% formic acid) mobile phase over a gradient of 15 min. All mass analyses were conducted using electrospray ionization in the positive mode with tandem mass spectrometry (ESI+/MS/MS). This is the first such application of 2-HP derivatization for the quantifications of the structurally and functionally diverse C19 androgen of 11-ketotestosterone; C21 progestogens of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone and17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone; and C21 corticosteroid of 11-deoxycortisol, in fathead minnow blood plasma. The limits of detection (LOD) were set to the lowest calibration standard that gave a signal-to-background response of ≥3, and were: 0.16 ng/ml for progesterone, 0.63 ng/ml for 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, 11-deoxycortisol and 17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone, and 1.25 ng/ml for 11-ketotestosterone. This study demonstrates the application of 2-HP derivatization for the analysis of a variety of steroid hormones representative of endocrine function in a species of fish commonly used in toxicological studies.

N2  - This study measured concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments in the East China Sea (ECS) to investigate possible sources and fate of PAHs. Total concentration of PAHs in the sediments of the ECS ranged from 22 to 244 ng g(-1), with the highest levels in the coastal area and outer shelf. The observed PAH results showed elevated levels in both inner and outer shelf areas, a finding that is different from predictions by an ocean circulation model, suggesting that terrestrial sources are important for PAH contaminations in the ECS, while sediment resuspension, tidal changes and lateral transport may be important in affecting the distribution of PAHs in the outer shelf. The distribution of PAHs in the surface sediments of the ECS is similar to the distribution of carbonaceous materials (e.g., particulate organic carbon and black carbon), suggesting that carbonaceous materials may strongly affect the distribution of PAHs.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which the fish liver is perfused with blood. Transonic® flow probes were therefore implanted around the ventral aorta and hepatic vein(s) to record baseline blood flows in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) previously held under two different feeding regimes (food-deprived or fed to satiation, 8-12 weeks). Fish from both groups were exposed to a gradual temperature decrease (12°C to 5°C) and physical disturbance. Cardiac output (Q), stroke volume (Sv) and hepatic venous blood flow (HVBF) were significantly reduced in food-deprived trout at 12°C. Heart rate was not significantly affected by nutritional status, but was significantly reduced when temperature was decreased to 5°C. Physically disturbing each fish at 12°C and 5°C showed that the performance capacity of the heart was not affected by food deprivation as the capacity to increase Q and Sv was not reduced in the food-deprived group. Overall this study showed that food deprivation in rainbow trout reduced cardiac and hepatic blood flows. However, long-term food deprivation did not affect the capacity of the heart to acutely increase performance.

N2  - Remipedia is one of the most recently discovered classes of crustaceans, first described in 1981 from anchialine caves in the Bahamas Archipelago. The class is divided into the order Enantiopoda, represented by two fossil species, and Nectiopoda, which contains all known extant remipedes. Since their discovery, the number of nectiopodan species has increased to 24, half of which were described during the last decade. Nectiopoda exhibit a disjunct global distribution pattern, with the highest abundance and diversity in the Caribbean region, and isolated species in the Canary Islands and in Western Australia. Our review of Remipedia provides an overview of their ecological characteristics, including a detailed list of all anchialine marine caves, from which species have been recorded. We discuss alternative hypotheses of the phylogenetic position of Remipedia within Arthropoda, and present first results of an ongoing molecular-phylogenetic analysis that do not support the monophyly of several nectiopodan taxa. We believe that a taxonomic revision of Remipedia is absolutely essential, and that a comprehensive revision should include a reappraisal of the fossil record.

N2  - Concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) plotted vs. dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater samples taken from a coastal plain aquifer of South Carolina (SC) showed a statistically significant hyperbolic relationship. In contrast, DO-DOC plots of groundwater samples taken from the eastern San Joaquin Valley of California (CA) showed a random scatter. It was hypothesized that differences in the bioavailability of naturally occurring DOC might contribute to these observations. This hypothesis was examined by comparing nine different biochemical indicators of DOC bioavailability in groundwater sampled from these two systems. Concentrations of DOC, total hydrolysable neutral sugars (THNS), total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA), mole% glycine of THAA, initial bacterial cell counts, bacterial growth rates, and carbon dioxide production/consumption were greater in SC samples relative to CA samples. In contrast, the mole% glucose of THNS and the aromaticity (SUVA(254)) of DOC was greater in CA samples. Each of these indicator parameters were observed to change with depth in the SC system in a manner consistent with active biodegradation. These results are uniformly consistent with the hypothesis that the bioavailability of DOC is greater in SC relative to CA groundwater samples. This, in turn, suggests that the presence/absence of a hyperbolic DO-DOC relationship may be a qualitative indicator of relative DOC bioavailability in groundwater systems.

N2  - Iodine occurs in multiple oxidation states in aquatic systems in the form of organic and inorganic species. This feature leads to complex biogeochemical cycling of stable iodine and its long-lived isotope, (129)I. In this study, we investigated the sorption, transport, and interconversion of iodine species by comparing their mobility in groundwaters at ambient concentrations of iodine species (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) to those at artificially elevated concentrations (78.7 μM), which often are used in laboratory analyses. Results demonstrate that the mobility of iodine species greatly depends on, in addition to the type of species, the iodine concentration used, presumably limited by the number of surface organic carbon binding sites to form covalent bonds. At ambient concentrations, iodide and iodate were significantly retarded (K(d) values as high as 49 mL g(-1)), whereas at concentrations of 78.7 μM, iodide traveled along with the water without retardation. Appreciable amounts of iodide during transport were retained in soils due to iodination of organic carbon, specifically retained by aromatic carbon. At high input concentration of iodate (78.7 μM), iodate was found to be reduced to iodide and subsequently followed the transport behavior of iodide. These experiments underscore the importance of studying iodine geochemistry at ambient concentrations and demonstrate the dynamic nature of their speciation during transport conditions.

N2  - Anhydrosugars, such as levoglucosan and its isomers (mannosan, galactosan), as well as the solvent-extractable lignin phenols (methoxylated phenols) are thermal degradation products of cellulose/hemicellulose and lignin, respectively. These two groups of biomarkers are often used as unique tracers of combusted biomass inputs in diverse environmental media. However, detailed characterization of the relative proportion and signatures of these compounds in highly heterogeneous plant-derived chars are still scarce. Here we conducted a systematic study to investigate the yields of solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and lignin phenols in 25 lab-made chars produced from different plant materials under different combustion conditions. Solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and lignin phenols were only observed in chars formed below 350°C and yields were variable across different combustion temperatures. The yields of mannosan (M) and galactosan (G) decreased more rapidly than those of levoglucosan (L) under increasing combustion severity (temperature and duration), resulting in variable L/M and L/(M+G) ratios, two diagnostic ratios often used for identification of combustion sources (e.g. hardwoods vs. softwoods vs. grasses). Our observations thus may provide an explanation for the wide ranges of values reported in the literature for these two ratios. On the other hand, the results of this study suggest that the ratios of the major solvent-extractable lignin phenols (vanillyls (V), syringyls (S), cinnamyls (C)) provide additional source reconstruction potential despite observed variations with combustion temperature. We thus propose using a property-property plot (L/M vs. S/V) as an improved means for source characterization of biomass combustion residues. The L/M-S/V plot has shown to be effective in environmental samples (soil organic matter, atmospheric aerosols) receiving substantial inputs of biomass combustion residues.

N2  - The unique properties of engineered nanoparticles (ENs) that make their industrial applications so attractive simultaneously raise questions regarding their environmental safety. ENs exhibit behaviors different from bulk materials with identical chemical compositions. Though the nanotoxicity of ENs has been studied intensively, their unintended environmental impacts remain largely unknown. Herein we report experimental results of EN interactions with exopolymeric substances (EPS) from three marine phytoplankton species: Amphora sp., Ankistrodesmus angustus and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. EPS are polysaccharide-rich anionic colloid polymers released by various microorganisms that can assemble into microgels, possibly by means of hydrophobic and ionic mechanisms. Polystyrene nanoparticles (23 nm) were used in our study as model ENs. The effects of ENs on EPS assembly were monitored with dynamic laser scattering (DLS). We found that ENs can induce significant acceleration in Amphora sp. EPS assembly; after 72 hours EN-EPS aggregation reached equilibrium, forming microscopic gels of ∼4-6 µm in size. In contrast, ENs only cause moderate assembly kinetic acceleration for A. angustus and P. tricornutum EPS samples. Our results indicate that the effects of ENs on EPS assembly kinetics mainly depend on the hydrophobic interactions of ENs with EPS polymers. The cycling mechanism of EPS is complex. Nonetheless, the change of EPS assembly kinetics induced by ENs can be considered as one potential disturbance to the marine carbon cycle.

N2  - In order to quantify changes in iodine speciation and to assess factors controlling the distribution and mobility of iodine at an iodine-129 ((129)I) contaminated site located at the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), spatial distributions and transformation of (129)I and stable iodine ((127)I) species in groundwater were investigated along a gradient in redox potential (654 to 360 mV), organic carbon concentration (5 to 60 μmol L(-1)), and pH (pH 3.2 to 6.8). Total (129)I concentration in groundwater was 8.6±2.8 Bq L(-1) immediately downstream of a former waste seepage basin (well FSB-95DR), and decreased with distance from the seepage basin. (127)I concentration decreased similarly to that of (129)I. Elevated concentrations of (127)I or (129)I were not detected in groundwater collected from wells located outside of the mixed waste plume of this area. At FSB-95DR, the majority (55-86%) of iodine existed as iodide for both (127)I and (129)I. Then, as the iodide move down gradient, some of it transformed into iodate and organo-iodine. Considering that iodate has a higher K(d) value than iodide, we hypothesize that the production of iodate in groundwater resulted in the removal of iodine from the groundwater and consequently decreased concentrations of (127)I and (129)I in downstream areas. Significant amounts of organo-iodine species (30-82% of the total iodine) were also observed at upstream wells, including those outside the mixed waste plume. Concentrations of groundwater iodide decreased at a faster rate than organo-iodine along the transect from the seepage basin. We concluded that removal of iodine from the groundwater through the formation of high molecular weight organo-iodine species is complicated by the release of other more mobile organo-iodine species in the groundwater.

N2  - Speciation remains one of the most controversial and least understood topics in evolution. About 75% of the earth's surface is covered by oceans. However, most of what we currently know about speciation is strongly biased toward terrestrial and freshwater organisms. Here, we discuss some of the major advances of the past two decades in our understanding of speciation in the sea and outline promising future directions that were gathered during the 2011 SICB Symposium "Speciation in the Sea."

N2  - <jats:p> The rising cost of floods is increasingly attributed to the pattern and form of the built environment. Our study empirically tests this notion by examining the relationship between development intensity and property damage caused by floods. We examine five years of insured flood loss claims across 144 counties and parishes fringing the Gulf of Mexico. Results indicate that clustered, high-intensity development patterns significantly reduce amounts of reported property damage, while increasing percentages of sprawling, low-intensity development involving recent conversion of open space greatly exacerbate flood losses. These findings demonstrate the importance of community development design in fostering flood-resilient communities. </jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. The time-series station, SEATS (18° N, 116° E) in the South China Sea was visited six times during October 2006–December 2008 to carry out seawater sampling and floating trap deployments for the determination of distributions and fluxes of POC, PIC, PN, 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po in the upper 200 m of the water column. Radionuclide deficiencies resulted in removal fluxes from the euphotic layer of 1.1 × 103–1.8 × 103 dpm m−2 d−1 and 7.1–40.2 dpm m−2 d−1 for 234Th and 210Po, respectively. Due to atmospheric input, an excess of 210Pb relative to 226Ra is commonly observed in the upper water column. Sinking fluxes of total mass, POC, PIC, PN, 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po measured at the euphotic depth were low in summer-fall and high in winter-spring, reflecting the seasonal variability of biological pumping. Excluding the suspiciously low primary productivity data point in July 2007, a relatively high e-ratio of 0.28–0.69 was estimated by the ratio of the POC flux at the euphotic depth and the integrated primary productivity. The ratios of 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po to organic carbon, inorganic carbon, and nitrogen in the sinking particles were combined with the disequilibria of 234Th-238U, 210Pb-226Ra, and 210Po-210Pb to estimate export fluxes of POC, PIC, and PN from the euphotic layer. Compared with measured fluxes by the sediment trap and estimated fluxes by other approaches, it is concluded that the export production in the South China Sea, ranging from 1.8 to 21.3 mmol-C m−2 d−1, can be reasonably estimated using 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po as carbon proxies.

N2  - Solvent-extractable monomeric methoxyphenols in aerosol samples conventionally have been used to indicate the influence of biomass combustion. In addition, the presence of lignin oxidation products (LOP), derived from the CuO oxidation of vascular plant organic matter, can help trace the source and inputs of primary biological particles in aerosols. Ambient aerosols (coarse and fine) collected in Houston during summer 2010 were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize monomeric and polymeric sources of LOPs. This is the first time polymeric forms of the LOPs have been characterized in ambient aerosols. The absence or small concentrations of solvent-extractable monomeric LOPs and levoglucosan isomers point to the limited influence of biomass burning during the sampling period. The trace levels of anhydrosugar concentrations most likely result from long-range transport. This observation is supported by the absence of co-occurring lignin monomers that undergo photochemical degradation during transport. The larger concentration (142 ng m(-3)) of lignin polymers in coarse aerosols shows the relative importance of primary biological aerosol particles, even in the urban atmosphere. The LOP parameters suggest a predominant influence from woody tissue of angiosperms, with minor influence from soft tissues, gymnosperms, and soil organic matter.

N2  - Neotropical reef fish communities are species-poor compared to those of the Indo-West Pacific. An exception to that pattern is the blenny clade Chaenopsidae, one of only three rocky and coral reef fish families largely endemic to the Neotropics. Within the chaenopsids, the genus Acanthemblemaria is the most species-rich and is characterized by elaborate spinous processes on the skull. Here we construct a species tree using five nuclear markers and compare the results to those from Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic analyses of 60 morphological characters. The sequence-based species tree conflicted with the morphological phylogenies for Acanthemblemaria, primarily due to the convergence of a suite of characters describing the distribution of spines on the head. However, we were able to resolve some of these conflicts by performing phylogenetic analyses on suites of characters not associated with head spines. By using the species tree as a guide, we used a quantitative method to identify suites of correlated morphological characters that, together, produce the distinctive skull phenotypes found in these fishes. A time calibrated phylogeny with nearly complete taxon sampling provided divergence time estimates that recovered a mid-Miocene origin for the genus, with a temporally and geographically complex pattern of speciation both before and after the closure of the Isthmus of Panama. Some sister taxa are broadly sympatric, but many occur in allopatry. The ability to infer the geography of speciation in Acanthemblemaria is complicated by extinctions, incomplete knowledge of their present geographic ranges and by wide-spread taxa that likely represent cryptic species complexes.

N2  - Stable isotope analysis has emerged as one of the primary means for examining the structure and dynamics of food webs, and numerous analytical approaches are now commonly used in the field. Techniques range from simple, qualitative inferences based on the isotopic niche, to Bayesian mixing models that can be used to characterize food-web structure at multiple hierarchical levels. We provide a comprehensive review of these techniques, and thus a single reference source to help identify the most useful approaches to apply to a given data set. We structure the review around four general questions: (1) what is the trophic position of an organism in a food web?; (2) which resource pools support consumers?; (3) what additional information does relative position of consumers in isotopic space reveal about food-web structure?; and (4) what is the degree of trophic variability at the intrapopulation level? For each general question, we detail different approaches that have been applied, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each. We conclude with a set of suggestions that transcend individual analytical approaches, and provide guidance for future applications in the field.

N2  - Human pharmaceuticals are routinely being detected in the environment, and there is growing concern about whether these drugs could elicit effects on aquatic organisms. Regulatory paradigms have shifted accordingly, with a greater emphasis on chronic toxicity data compared with acute data. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 210 Early Life Stage Test has been proposed as a good measure of the potential for pharmaceuticals to elicit chronic toxicity. To begin building a data set regarding the early life-stage toxicity of pharmaceuticals to fish, fathead minnows (FHM) were exposed to amiodarone, carbamazepine, clozapine, dexamethasone, fenofibrate, ibuprofen, norethindrone, or verapamil. Survival and growth were used to assess chronic toxicity in FHM at 28 days posthatch. Exposure of FHM to carbamazepine, fenofibrate, and ibuprofen resulted in no significant adverse effects at the concentrations tested. FHM survival was not impacted by verapamil exposure; however, growth was significantly decreased at 600 μg/L. Dexamethasone-exposed FHM showed a significant decrease in survival at a concentration of 577 μg/L; however, growth was not impacted at the concentration tested. Norethindrone exposure resulted in a significant decrease in survival and dry weight at 14.8 and 0.74 μg/L, respectively. Exposure to amiodarone and clozapine resulted in a significant decrease in survival and a significant increase in growth at concentrations of 1020 and 30.8 μg/L, respectively. Although the effect levels derived in this study are greater then concentrations observed in the environment, these data suggest that synthetic progestins may require additional research.

N2  - In order to investigate the distributions and speciation of (129)I (and (127)I) in a contaminated F-Area groundwater plume of the Savannah River Site that cannot be explained by simple transport models, soil resuspension experiments simulating surface runoff or stormflow and erosion events were conducted. Results showed that 72-77% of the newly introduced I(-) or IO(3)(-) were irreversibly sequestered into the organic-rich riparian soil, while the rest was transformed by the soil into colloidal and truly dissolved organo-iodine, resulting in (129)I remobilization from the soil greatly exceeding the 1 pCi/L drinking water permit. This contradicts the conventional view that only considers I(-) or IO(3)(-) as the mobile forms. Laboratory iodination experiments indicate that iodine likely covalently binds to aromatic structures of the soil organic matter (SOM). Under very acidic conditions, abiotic iodination of SOM was predominant, whereas under less acidic conditions (pH ≥5), microbial enzymatically assisted iodination of SOM was predominant. The organic-rich soil in the vadose zone of F-Area thus acts primarily as a "sink," but may also behave as a potentially important vector for mobile radioiodine in an on-off carrying mechanism. Generally the riparian zone provides as a natural attenuation zone that greatly reduces radioiodine release.

N2  - Chemically selective chemisorbents are needed to monitor natural and engineered waters for anthropogenic releases of stable and radioactive contaminants. Here, a number of individual and mixtures of chemisorbents were investigated for their ability to extract select fission and activation product elements from marine and coastal waters, including Co, Zr, Ru, Ag, Te, Sb, Ba, Cs, Ce, Eu, Pa, Np, and Th. Conventional manganese oxide and cyanoferrate sorbents, including commercially available Anfezh and potassium hexacyanocobalt(II) ferrate(II) (KCFC), were tested along with novel nano-structured surfaces (known as Self Assembled Monolayers on Mesoporous Supports or SAMMS) functionalized with a variety of moieties including thiol, diphosphonic acid (DiPhos-), methyl-3,4 hydroxypyridinone (HOPO-), and cyanoferrate. Extraction efficiencies were measured as a function of salinity, organic content, temperature, flow rate and sample size for both synthetic and natural fresh and saline waters under a range of environmentally relevant conditions. The effect of flow rate on extraction efficiency, from 1 to 70 mL min(-1), provided some insight on rate limitations of mechanisms affecting sorption processes. Optimized mixtures of sorbent-ligand chemistries afforded excellent retention of all target elements, except, Ba and Sb. Mixtures of tested chemisorbents, including MnO(2)/Anfezh and MnO(2)/KCFC/Thiol (1-3 mm)-SAMMS, extracted 8 of the 11 target elements studied to better than 80% efficiency, while a mixture of MnO(2)/Anfezh/Thiol (75-150 μm)-SAMMS mixture was able to extract 7 of the 11 target elements to better than 90%. Results generated here indicate that flow rate should be less of a consideration for experimental design if sampling from fresh water containing variable amounts of DOM, rather than collecting samples from salt water environments. Relative to the capability of any single type of chemisorbent tested, optimized mixtures of several sorbents are able to increase the number of elements that can be efficiently and simultaneously extracted from natural waters.

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. The time-series station, SEATS (18° N, 116° E) in the South China Sea was visited six times during October 2006–December 2008 to carry out seawater sampling and floating trap deployments for the determination of distributions and fluxes of POC, PIC, PN, 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po in the upper 200 m of the water column. Radionuclide deficiencies resulted in removal fluxes from the euphotic layer of 1.1×103–1.8×103 dpm m−2d−1 and 7.1–40.2 dpm m−2d−1 for 234Th and 210Po, respectively. Due to atmospheric input, an excess of 210Pb relative to 226Ra is commonly observed in the upper water column. Sinking fluxes of total mass, POC, PIC, PN, 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po measured at the euphotic depth were low in summer-fall and high in winter-spring, reflecting the seasonal variability of biological pumping. Excluding the suspiciously low primary productivity data point in July 2007, a relatively high e-ratio of 0.28–0.69 was estimated by the ratio of the POC flux at the euphotic depth and the integrated primary productivity. The ratios of 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po to organic carbon, inorganic carbon, and nitrogen in the sinking particles were combined with the disequilibria of 234Th–238U, 210Pb–226Ra, and 210Po–210Pb to estimate export fluxes of POC, PIC, and PN from the euphotic layer. Compared with measured fluxes by the sediment trap and estimated fluxes by other approaches, it is concluded that the export production in the South China Sea, ranging from 1.8 to 21.3 mmol-C m−2d−1, can be reasonably estimated using 234Th, 210Pb, and 210Po as carbon proxies.

N2  - Atyid freshwater shrimps are globally distributed and form an important part of freshwater ecosystems, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. Despite their widespread distribution and ecological importance, their phylogenetic relationships are largely unresolved. Here we present the first comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the Atyidae investigating the evolutionary relationships among 32 of the 42 genera using mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Our data indicate that the established classification of the Atyidae is in need of substantial taxonomic revision at all taxonomic levels. We suggest a new suprageneric systematization of atyids and discuss problematic issues at the generic level, particularly in the most speciose genus, Caridina. Molecular clock based divergence time estimates for atyids vary widely, but invariably support the assumption that atyids are an ancient freshwater lineage with an origin in the mid-Cretaceous at the very latest. Atyid distribution patterns are the result of instances of both long-distance dispersal and vicariance, depending largely on the reproductive mode of taxa. From an evolutionary perspective, the high frequency of independent origin of both a complete (landlocked) freshwater life cycle and a cave-dwelling mode of life is remarkable and unparalleled among crustaceans.

N2  - An efficient and high-throughput method to characterize lignin in environmental samples using alkaline CuO oxidation and capillary gas chromatography with mass detection is presented. Monomeric lignin phenols released during oxidation were selectively extracted using a polymer-based solid phase sorbent rather than liquid phase extraction. Sample size and matrix were found to influence lignin phenol yields. Increasing the sample size to an organic carbon content ≥1.5 mg of C minimizes phenol oxidation losses, and the addition of glucose as a sacrificial carbon source helped minimize oxidation losses in samples with <5 mg of organic carbon.

N2  - The ability of engineered black carbons (or biochars) to resist abiotic and, or biotic degradation (herein referred to as recalcitrance) is crucial to their successful deployment as a soil carbon sequestration strategy. A new recalcitrance index, the R(50), for assessing biochar quality for carbon sequestration is proposed. The R(50) is based on the relative thermal stability of a given biochar to that of graphite and was developed and evaluated with a variety of biochars (n = 59), and soot-like black carbons. Comparison of R(50), with biochar physicochemical properties and biochar-C mineralization revealed the existence of a quantifiable relationship between R(50) and biochar recalcitrance. As presented here, the R(50) is immediately applicable to pre-land application screening of biochars into Class A (R(50) ≥ 0.70), Class B (0.50 ≤ R(50) < 0.70) or Class C (R(50) < 0.50) recalcitrance/carbon sequestration classes. Class A and Class C biochars would have carbon sequestration potential comparable to soot/graphite and uncharred plant biomass, respectively, whereas Class B biochars would have intermediate carbon sequestration potential. We believe that the coupling of the R(50), to an index-based degradation, and an economic model could provide a suitable framework in which to comprehensively assess soil carbon sequestration in biochars.

N2  - <jats:p>A new species of Remipedia (Crustacea) is described from a recently discovered section of the anchialine cave systemCenote Crustacea, situated on the northeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. Speleonectes fuchscockburni n. sp. is thesecond remipede species from the Caribbean coast of Mexico. Adult specimens are relatively small and slender, with bodylengths between 12 and 16 mm, and up to 35 trunk segments. The new species can be distinguished morphologically fromS. tulumensis by sparsely setose appendages, a ventral antennular flagellum composed of 5–6 segments, and 10–12 deeplyincised denticles of the terminal maxillary and maxillpedal claws. The status of Speleonectes fuchscockburni as a new spe-cies is validated by a comparison of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences from selected remipede taxa, includ-ing Speleonectes tulumensis. The uniquely high abundance of S. tulumensis in Cenote Crustacea and the distribution of the two remipedes in this cave are discussed in relation to hydrology and cave morphology.</jats:p>

N2  - Increasing energy prices demand a renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuel that is environmentally and commercially sustainable. The interest in the production of microalgae as biofuels is increasing due to their high oil content, rapid biomass production and small foot print. In this research, marine microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta (Chlorophyceae) and Thalassiosira pseudonana (Bacillariophyceae) were incubated in nitrogen (N)-replete medium, and then transferred to N-free medium for 15 and 11 days, respectively. Fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) fluorometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to monitor the photosynthetic performance, lipid production and metabolic responses to changing N availability. Growth rates of D. tertiolecta and T. pseudonana were 0.84 ± 0.16 d(-1) and 1.21 ± 0.09 d(-), respectively in N-replete medium. Upon transfer to N-free medium. The growth rates of T. pseudonana declined rapidly, while D. tertiolecta continued to grow for 5 days in N-free medium before growth declined slowly. The maximum quantum yield of photochemistry (F(v)/F(m)) remained high initially for D. tertiolecta but decreased immediately after transfer to N-free media for T. pseudonana. The functional absorption cross section for PSII (σ(PSII)) increased, the time constant for Q(A) reoxidation (τ(Qa)) and connectivity factor (p) decreased in parallel to the nutritional status of the microalgae. The relative protein and lipid content varied in response to N limitation, but carbohydrates did not change. Based on FTIR, D. tertiolecta and T. pseudonana produced 20-26% lipid when most stressed. The combination of photosynthetic efficiency and biomass composition monitoring provided evidence that metabolic strategies to changing nutrient status are species-specific.

N2  - Ballast water exchange processes facilitate the dispersal and unnatural geographic expansion of phytoplankton, including harmful algal bloom species. From 2005 to 2010, over 45,000 vessels (≈ 8000 annually) travelled across Galveston Bay (Texas, USA) to the deep-water ports of Houston (10th largest in the world), Texas City and Galveston. These vessels (primarily tankers and bulkers) discharged ≈ 1.2 × 10(8) metrictons of ballast water; equivalent to ≈ 3.4% of the total volume of the Bay. Over half of the ballast water discharged had a coastwise origin, 96% being from US waters. Galveston Bay has fewer non-indigenous species but receives a higher volume of ballast water discharge, relative to the highly invaded Chesapeake and San Francisco Bays. Given the magnitude of shipping traffic, the role of Galveston Bay, both as a recipient and donor region of non-indigenous phytoplankton species is discussed here in terms of the invasibility risk to this system by way of ballast water.

N2  - Passive electroreception is a widespread sense in fishes and amphibians, but in mammals this sensory ability has previously only been shown in monotremes. While the electroreceptors in fish and amphibians evolved from mechanosensory lateral line organs, those of monotremes are based on cutaneous glands innervated by trigeminal nerves. Electroreceptors evolved from other structures or in other taxa were unknown to date. Here we show that the hairless vibrissal crypts on the rostrum of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), structures originally associated with the mammalian whiskers, serve as electroreceptors. Histological investigations revealed that the vibrissal crypts possess a well-innervated ampullary structure reminiscent of ampullary electroreceptors in other species. Psychophysical experiments with a male Guiana dolphin determined a sensory detection threshold for weak electric fields of 4.6 µV cm(-1), which is comparable to the sensitivity of electroreceptors in platypuses. Our results show that electroreceptors can evolve from a mechanosensory organ that nearly all mammals possess and suggest the discovery of this kind of electroreception in more species, especially those with an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle.

N2  - Remipedes are a small and enigmatic group of crustaceans, first described only 30 years ago. Analyses of both morphological and molecular data have recently suggested a close relationship between Remipedia and Hexapoda. If true, the remipedes occupy an important position in pancrustacean evolution and may be pivotal for understanding the evolutionary history of crustaceans and hexapods. However, it is important to test this hypothesis using new data and new types of analytical approaches. Here, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 131 taxa, incorporating newly generated 454 expressed sequence tag (EST) data from six species of crustaceans, representing five lineages (Remipedia, Laevicaudata, Spinicaudata, Ostracoda, and Malacostraca). This data set includes all crustacean species for which EST data are available (46 species), and our largest alignment encompasses 866,479 amino acid positions and 1,886 genes. A series of phylogenomic analyses was performed to evaluate pancrustacean relationships. We significantly improved the quality of our data for predicting putative orthologous genes and for generating data subsets by matrix reduction procedures, thereby improving the signal to noise ratio in the data. Eight different data sets were constructed, representing various combinations of orthologous genes, data subsets, and taxa. Our results demonstrate that the different ways to compile an initial data set of core orthologs and the selection of data subsets by matrix reduction can have marked effects on the reconstructed phylogenetic trees. Nonetheless, all eight data sets strongly support Pancrustacea with Remipedia as the sister group to Hexapoda. This is the first time that a sister group relationship of Remipedia and Hexapoda has been inferred using a comprehensive phylogenomic data set that is based on EST data. We also show that selecting data subsets with increased overall signal can help to identify and prevent artifacts in phylogenetic analyses.

N2  - Fluid-dynamic transport and mixing processes affect birth, death, immigration and emigration rates in kelp forests, and can modulate broader community interactions. In the most highly studied canopy-forming kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (the giant kelp), models of hydrodynamic and oceanographic phenomena influencing spore movement provide bounds on reproduction, quantify patterns of local and regional propagule supply, identify scales of population connectivity, and establish context for agents of early life mortality. Other analyses yield insight into flow-mediated species interactions within kelp forests. In each case, advances emerge from the use of ecomechanical approaches that propagate physical-biological connections at the scale of the individual to higher levels of ecological organization. In systems where physical factors strongly influence population, community or ecosystem properties, such mechanics-based methods promote crucial progress but are just beginning to realize their full potential.

N2  - Highly expressed proteins can exhibit relatively small material costs, in terms of the quantities of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) or sulphur (S) atoms they contain. This 'elemental sparing' probably reflects selection to reduce the quantities of potentially growth-limiting elements in abundant proteins, but the evolutionary mechanisms for adaptive elemental sparing are still poorly understood. Here, we predict that the extent of 'elemental sparing' in highly expressed proteins will vary among organisms, according to the effectiveness of selection in determining the fate of mutations. We test this hypothesis in bacteria by asking whether 'elemental sparing' is correlated with codon usage bias. Bacteria exhibit extraordinary variation in their life histories and demography and consequently in the effectiveness of selection in determining whether preferred codons are used in highly expressed genes. We find that C sparing and S sparing, but not N sparing, are significantly correlated with adaptive codon usage bias among 148 genera of bacteria, suggesting that selection for elemental sparing and codon bias are promoted by similar bacterial traits. Our study helps identify principles that determine how nutrient scarcity can shape the elemental composition of proteins.

N2  - As early as the passage of the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act the U.S. government has sought to protect the nation's water resources through regulatory tools. While there has been a large amount of research on wetlands and wetland mitigation, very little is known about the impact of Section 404 permitting on water quantity. This research examines the impact of Section 404 permit types on peak annual streamflow in Coastal Texas from 1996 to 2003. Results of cross-sectional time-series regression analyses indicate that all four permit types have positive and significant effects on peak streamflow. These effects also vary by permit type, with Individual permits having the highest per-permit impact on peak annual flow.

N2  - Vibrissae (whiskers) are important components of the mammalian tactile sensory system, and primarily function as detectors of vibrotactile information from the environment. Pinnipeds possess the largest vibrissae among mammals and their vibrissal hair shafts demonstrate a diversity of shapes. The vibrissae of most phocid seals exhibit a beaded morphology with repeating sequences of crests and troughs along their length. However, there are few detailed analyses of pinniped vibrissal morphology, and these are limited to a few species. Therefore, we comparatively characterized differences in vibrissal hair shaft morphologies among phocid species with a beaded profile, phocid species with a smooth profile, and otariids with a smooth profile using traditional and geometric morphometric methods. Traditional morphometric measurements (peak-to-peak distance, crest width, trough width and total length) were collected using digital photographs. Elliptic Fourier analysis (geometric morphometrics) was used to quantify the outlines of whole vibrissae. The traditional and geometric morphometric datasets were subsequently combined by mathematically scaling each to true rank, followed by a single eigendecomposition. Quadratic discriminant function analysis demonstrated that 79.3, 97.8 and 100% of individuals could be correctly classified to their species based on vibrissal shape variables in the traditional, geometric and combined morphometric analyses, respectively. Phocids with beaded vibrissae, phocids with smooth vibrissae, and otariids each occupied distinct morphospace in the geometric morphometric and combined data analyses. Otariids split into two groups in the geometric morphometric analysis and gray seals appeared intermediate between beaded- and smooth-whiskered species in the traditional and combined analyses. Vibrissal hair shafts modulate the transduction of environmental stimuli to the mechanoreceptors in the follicle-sinus complex (F-SC), which results in vibrotactile reception, but it is currently unclear how the diversity of shapes affects environmental signal modulation.

N2  - <jats:p>Effects of inflow on phytoplankton dynamics and assemblage structure have long been an interest of ecologists and resource managers, especially when they are linked to the incidence of harmful algal blooms. The frequency and magnitude of Prymnesium parvum bloom-preventing inflows likely in a drier landscape of south-central USA was explored, along with the relative importance of various factors important to blooms. We show that the number of large inflow events necessary to prevent blooms might decrease between 25% and 65% under drier conditions likely for this region. Long duration inflow events that are critical to lake flushing could nearly disappear, with inflow events lasting longer than 20 days decreasing 40-fold. These findings suggest that the frequency of P. parvum blooms and fish-kill events might increase in this region with human population and climate change. Multivariate analyses of monitoring data from multiple lakes indicate that other factors may be equally important to bloom occurrences. Inverse trends between toxic bloom events and nutrient concentrations, cyanobacteria, and lower pH are apparent. During periods when P. parvum populations were not toxic, an inverse relationship with zooplankton was observed. These other factors might be harnessed to mitigate P. parvum blooms in the future when inflows are reduced.</jats:p>

N2  - We demonstrate the first successful growth of large-area (200 × 200 μm(2)) bilayer, Bernal stacked, epitaxial graphene (EG) on atomically flat, 4H-SiC (0001) step-free mesas (SFMs) . The use of SFMs for the growth of graphene resulted in the complete elimination of surface step-bunching typically found after EG growth on conventional nominally on-axis SiC (0001) substrates. As a result heights of EG surface features are reduced by at least a factor of 50 from the heights found on conventional substrates. Evaluation of the EG across the SFM using the Raman 2D mode indicates Bernal stacking with low and uniform compressive lattice strain of only 0.05%. The uniformity of this strain is significantly improved, which is about 13-fold decrease of strain found for EG grown on conventional nominally on-axis substrates. The magnitude of the strain approaches values for stress-free exfoliated graphene flakes. Hall transport measurements on large area bilayer samples taken as a function of temperature from 4.3 to 300 K revealed an n-type carrier mobility that increased from 1170 to 1730 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), and a corresponding sheet carrier density that decreased from 5.0 × 10(12) cm(-2) to 3.26 × 10(12) cm(-2). The transport is believed to occur predominantly through the top EG layer with the bottom layer screening the top layer from the substrate. These results demonstrate that EG synthesized on large area, perfectly flat on-axis mesa surfaces can be used to produce Bernal-stacked bilayer EG having excellent uniformity and reduced strain and provides the perfect opportunity for significant advancement of epitaxial graphene electronics technology.

N2  - Ichthyoplankton surveys were conducted in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM) over a three-year period (2006-2008) to determine the relative value of this region as early life habitat of sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), white marlin (Kajikia albida), and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Sailfish were the dominant billfish collected in summer surveys, and larvae were present at 37.5% of the stations sampled. Blue marlin and white marlin larvae were present at 25.0% and 4.6% of the stations sampled, respectively, while swordfish occurred at 17.2% of the stations. Areas of peak production were detected and maximum density estimates for sailfish (22.09 larvae 1000 m(-2)) were significantly higher than the three other species: blue marlin (9.62 larvae 1000 m(-2)), white marlin (5.44 larvae 1000 m(-2)), and swordfish (4.67 larvae 1000 m(-2)). The distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae varied spatially and temporally, and several environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, sea surface height, distance to the Loop Current, current velocity, water depth, and Sargassum biomass) were deemed to be influential variables in generalized additive models (GAMs). Mesoscale features in the NGoM affected the distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae, with densities typically higher in frontal zones or areas proximal to the Loop Current. Habitat suitability of all four species was strongly linked to physicochemical attributes of the water masses they inhabited, and observed abundance was higher in slope waters with lower sea surface temperature and higher salinity. Our results highlight the value of the NGoM as early life habitat of billfishes and swordfish, and represent valuable baseline data for evaluating anthropogenic effects (i.e., Deepwater Horizon oil spill) on the Atlantic billfish and swordfish populations.

N2  - Remipedia are enigmatic crustaceans of uncertain phylogenetic position with the general consensus that they are crucial for understanding the crustacean/arthropod evolution. It has been demonstrated previously that the features of the ovary organization and subcellular aspects of oogenesis are useful in resolving phylogenetic relationships in arthropods such as hexapods and onychophorans. The structure of the female gonads in Remipedia remains largely unknown; therefore, we examined the gross morphology and ultrastructural details of the ovary in a remipede, Godzilliognomus frondosus, with special emphasis on characters relevant to phylogenetic reconstructions. The ovaries of G. frondosus are located in the anterior part of the body and are composed of a single anterior proliferative zone (the germarium) and paired ovarian tubes (the vitellarium). The oocytes undergo subsequent stages of development within the lumen of the ovarian tubes, hence the remipede ovaries can be classified as endogenous. During oogenesis, each oocyte is enveloped by a set of characteristic somatic follicular cells, which results in the formation of distinct ovarian follicles. Here, we demonstrate that Remipedia share significant similarities in the ovary organization with Cephalocarida, including the anterior location of the ovary, the anterior-most position of the germarium and the endogenous type of oocyte development. Phylogenetic implications of our findings are discussed.

N2  - To develop an understanding of the role that microorganisms play in the transport of (129)I in soil-water systems, bacteria isolated from subsurface sediments were assessed for iodide oxidizing activity. Spent liquid medium from 27/84 bacterial cultures enhanced iodide oxidation 2-10 fold in the presence of H(2)O(2). Organic acids secreted by the bacteria were found to enhance iodide oxidation by (1) lowering the pH of the spent medium, and (2) reacting with H(2)O(2) to form peroxy carboxylic acids, which are extremely strong oxidizing agents. H(2)O(2)-dependent iodide oxidation increased exponentially from 8.4 to 825.9 μM with decreasing pH from 9 to 4. Organic acids with ≥2 carboxy groups enhanced H(2)O(2)-dependent iodide oxidation (1.5-15-fold) as a function of increasing pH above pH 6.0, but had no effect at pH ≤ 5.0. The results indicate that as pH decreases (≤5.0), increasing H(2)O(2) hydrolysis is the driving force behind iodide oxidation. However, at pH ≥ 6.0, spontaneous decomposition of peroxy carboxylic acids, generated from H(2)O(2) and organic acids, contributes significantly to iodide oxidation. The results reveal an indirect microbial mechanism, organic acid secretion coupled to H(2)O(2) production, that could enhance iodide oxidation and organo-iodine formation in soils and sediments.

The vertical graphene-semiconductor system, however, also presents opportunities for unique devices, yet there have been few attempts to understand the properties of carrier transport through the graphene sheet into an underlying substrate.

N2  - Prymnesium parvum blooms have become more frequent in the south-central United States, leading to significant ecological and economic impacts. Allelopathic effects from cyanobacteria were suggested as a mechanism that might limit the development of P. parvum blooms. This research focused on the effects of cultured cyanobacteria, Anabaena sp., on P. parvum. Over a 6-d period, daily additions of filtrate from the senescent Anabaena culture were made to P. parvum cultures growing in log phase. All treatments, including several types of controls, showed reductions in P. parvum biomass over the course of the experiment, but the treatments receiving Anabaena filtrate were reduced to a lesser degree, suggesting that filtrate from the senescent cyanobacteria culture was beneficial to P. parvum in some way. This unexpected outcome may have resulted from stimulation of heterotrophic bacteria by the addition of Anabaena filtrate, which likely contained exudates rich in dissolved organic carbon compounds. P. parvum was then able to supplement its nutritional requirements for growth by feeding on the elevated bacteria population. These findings coupled to previous observations suggest that interactions between cyanobacteria and P. parvum in natural environments are complex, where both allelopathic and growth-stimulating interactions are possible.

N2  - In this study, an in silico genome-scale metabolic model of steroidogenesis was used to investigate the effects of hypoxic stress on steroid hormone productions in fish. Adult female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to hypoxia for 7 days with fish sub-sampled on days 1, 3 and 7 of exposure. At each time point, selected steroid enzyme gene expressions and steroid hormone productions were quantified in ovaries. Fold changes in steroid enzyme gene expressions were used to qualitatively scale transcript enzyme reaction constraints (akin to the range of an enzyme's catalytic activity) in the in silico model. Subsequently, in silico predicted steroid hormone productions were qualitatively compared with experimental results. Key findings were as follows. (1) In silico gene deletion analysis identified highly conserved 'essential' genes required for steroid hormone productions. These agreed well (75%) with literature-published genes downregulated in vertebrates (fish and mammal) exposed to hypoxia. (2) Quantification of steroid hormones produced ex vivo from ovaries showed a significant reduction for 17β-estradiol and 17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone production after 24 h (day 1) of exposure. This lowered 17β-estradiol production was concomitant with downregulation of cyp19a1a gene expression in ovaries. In silico predictions showed agreement with experimentation by predicting effects on estrogen (17β-estradiol and estrone) production. (3) Stochastic sampling of in silico reactions indicated that cholesterol uptake and catalysis to pregnenolone along with estrogen methyltransferase and glucuronidation reactions were also impacted by hypoxia. Taken together, this in silico analysis introduces a powerful model for pathway analysis that can lend insights on the effects of various stressor scenarios on metabolic functions.

N2  - When aquatically adapted mammals and birds swim submerged, they exhibit a dive response in which breathing ceases, heart rate slows, and blood flow to peripheral tissues and organs is reduced. The most intense dive response occurs during forced submersion which conserves blood oxygen for the brain and heart, thereby preventing asphyxiation. In free-diving animals, the dive response is less profound, and energy metabolism remains aerobic. However, even this relatively moderate bradycardia seems diametrically opposed to the normal cardiovascular response (i.e., tachycardia and peripheral vasodilation) during physical exertion. As a result, there has been a long-standing paradox regarding how aquatic mammals and birds exercise while submerged. We hypothesized based on cardiovascular modeling that heart rate must increase to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to active muscles. Here, we show that heart rate (HR) does indeed increase with flipper or fluke stroke frequency (SF) during voluntary, aerobic dives in Weddell seals (HR = 1.48SF - 8.87) and bottlenose dolphins (HR = 0.99SF + 2.46), respectively, two marine mammal species with different evolutionary lineages. These results support our hypothesis that marine mammals maintain aerobic muscle metabolism while swimming submerged by combining elements of both dive and exercise responses, with one or the other predominating depending on the level of exertion.

N2  - An understudied, but central aspect in understanding flood impacts is the way we conceptualize, identify, and delineate risk. The 100-year floodplain is the longstanding metric in the United States for determining and acting upon the possibility of an area being inundated. This spatial delineation guides local planning and development decisions, triggers insurance purchases and other household adjustments, and serves as the fundamental indicator for whether it is safe to build a structure on a particular site. However, increasing evidence suggests that the 100-year floodplain is neither accurate nor sufficient in guiding communities and household decisions to mitigate the adverse economic impacts of floods. In this perspective, we examine the effectiveness of the 100-year floodplain as an appropriate marker of risk. First, we review existing studies on location and flood damage. Next, we apply these concepts to repetitive flood losses data in Harris County, Texas. We conclude that the apparent inability of the floodplain designation to effectively capture the likelihood of property damage and potential loss of human life in coastal areas has left potentially millions of property owners unaware of the flood risk and unprepared to mitigate their adverse impacts. Relying on traditional 100-year floodplain boundaries, local decision makers are hampered in their ability to ensure community development occurs in a resilient manner. Finally, we set forth an agenda for future research to better capture the conditions associated with flood risk and account for the large percentage of damage outside the designated floodplain.

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) from 137 water samples from different climate zones and different depths along an eastern Atlantic Ocean transect. The extracts were analyzed with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI). Δ14C analyses were performed on subsamples of the SPE-DOM. In addition, the amount of dissolved organic carbon was determined for all water and SPE-DOM samples as well as the yield of amino sugars for selected samples. Linear correlations were observed between the magnitudes of 43 % of the FT-ICR mass peaks and the extract Δ14C values. Decreasing SPE-DOM Δ14C values went along with a shift in the molecular composition to higher average masses (m/z) and lower hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratios. The correlation was used to model the SPE-DOM Δ14C distribution for all 137 samples. Based on single mass peaks, a degradation index (IDEG) was developed to compare the degradation state of marine SPE-DOM samples analyzed with FT-ICR MS. A correlation between Δ14C, IDEG, DOC values and amino sugar yield supports that SPE-DOM analyzed with FT-ICR MS reflects trends of bulk DOM. DOM weighted normalized mass peak magnitudes were used to compare aged and recent SPE-DOM on a semi-quantitative molecular basis. The magnitude comparison showed a continuum of different degradation rates for the detected compounds. A high proportion of the compounds should persist, possibly modified by partial degradation, in the course of thermohaline circulation. Prokaryotic (bacterial) production, transformation and accumulation of this very stable DOM occur primarily in the upper ocean. This DOM is an important contribution to very old DOM, showing that production and degradation are dynamic processes.

N2  - Combustion-derived PAHs and stable Pb isotopic signatures ((206)Pb/(207)Pb) in sedimentary records assisted in reconstructing the sources of atmospheric inputs of anthropogenic Pb and Hg to the Hood Canal, Washington. The sediment-focusing corrected peak fluxes of total Pb and Hg (1960-70s) demonstrate that the watershed of Hood Canal has received greater atmospheric inputs of these metals than its mostly rural land use would predict. The tight relationships between the Pb, Hg, and organic markers in the cores indicate that these metals are derived from industrial combustion emissions. Multiple lines of evidence point to the Asarco smelter, located in the Main Basin of Puget Sound, as the major emission source of these metals to the watershed of the Hood Canal. The evidence includes (1) similar PAH isomer ratios in sediment cores from the two basins, (2) the correlations between Pb, Hg, and Cu in sediments and previously studied environmental samples including particulate matter emitted from the Asarco smelter's main stack at the peak of production, and (3) Pb isotope ratios. The natural rate of recovery in Hood Canal since the 1970s, back to preindustrial metal concentrations, was linear and contrasts with recovery rates reported for the Main Basin which slowed post late 1980s.

N2  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>With a wide band gap of greater than 3.0 eV and the ability to self-heal from radiation damage, icosahedral boron arsenide (B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) is an apt candidate for use in next-generation betavoltaics. By capturing and converting high energy electrons from radioisotopes into usable electricity, “nuclear batteries” made from B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> could potentially power devices for decades. Compared to bulk crystals or epitaxial films, B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanowires may have lower defect densities or may even be defect-free, leading to better electrical properties and device performance. In our study, B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanowires were synthesized via vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth using platinum powder and nickel powder on silicon carbide and 20 nm thick nickel film on silicon substrates from 700 °C to 1200 °C. Platinum yielded the highest quality nanowires from 900 °C to 950 °C, resulting in platinum particles densely covered with wires formed by straight segments connected by sharp angular kinks. At these growth temperatures, diameters ranged from less than 30 nm to about 300 nm as determined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Growth temperatures of 850 °C or less produced curled wires 200-1000 nm in diameter. Transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction revealed excellent crystallinity in wires grown above 850 °C, while wires grown at or below 850 °C were partially amorphous. Wires grown from the 20 nm nickel film displayed similar morphologies at temperatures up to 850 °C; from 900 °C to 950 °C, straight, isolated wires were grown with diameters of 200-400 nm. Nickel powder only produced wires larger than 1 μm in diameter. The comparative quality and growth of B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>nanowires will be discussed.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p> This article addresses this understudied aspect of development patterns and community resiliency by examining a five-year record of insured flood loss claims across 144 counties and parishes fringing the Gulf of Mexico. Linear regression models are employed to isolate the effects of five different development patterns on observed flood losses from 2001 to 2005 while controlling for multiple contextual variables. A novel approach is taken to measuring development form by using a series of landscape metrics usually reserved for ecological analysis. These measures enable the assessment of the form of the regional built environment with more specificity than has been possible in previous studies. Results indicate that more connected and concentrated development patterns lead to a reduction in the amount of observed flood losses. These findings illustrate the importance of regional planning and design for fostering flood-resilient communities. </jats:p>

N2  - Soliton-like pulses with a 1984-nm center wavelength are produced from a Tm-doped mode-locked fiber laser. The linear cavity has a graphene saturable absorber mirror at one end and a fiber Bragg grating as the output coupler. The laser operates without dispersion compensation, and the repetition rate was tuned from 20 to 5 MHz by the addition of SMF-28 fiber. The dry transfer process used to place the graphene on a mirror could be extended to any optical substrate. This enables integration of graphene with optics such as an optical window coated with a graphene filter or a graphene-saturable absorber placed directly on a semiconductor laser facet. © The Authors.

N2  - Biased transitions are common throughout the tree of life. The class hydrozoa is no exception, having lost the feeding medusa stage at least 70 times. The family hydractiniidae includes one lineage with pelagic medusae (Podocoryna) and several without (e.g., Hydractinia). The benthic colony stage also varies widely in host specificity and in colony form. The five-gene phylogeny presented here requires multiple transitions between character states for medusae, host specificity, and colony phenotype. Significant phylogenetic correlations exist between medusoid form, colony morphology, and host specificity. Species with nonfeeding medusae are usually specialized on a single host type, and reticulate colonies are correlated with nonmotile hosts. The history of feeding medusae is less certain. Podocoryna is nested within five lineages lacking medusae. This requires either repeated losses of medusae, or the remarkable re-evolution of a feeding medusa after at least 150 million years. Traditional ancestral reconstruction favors medusa regain, but a likelihood framework testing biased transitions cannot distinguish between multiple losses versus regain. A hypothesis of multiple losses of feeding medusae requires transient selection pressure favoring such a loss. Populations of species with feeding medusae are always locally rare and lack of feeding medusae does not result in restricted species distribution around the world.

N2  - <jats:p> Water cycles are changing because of human population growth and climate change. Such changes will affect fundamental system-level characteristics that in turn will greatly influence ecosystem form and functioning. Here, a collection of papers is offered that furthers our understanding of cause and effect relationships between altered hydrology and various ecosystem properties. Combined, these papers address issues related to inflows, connectivity, and circulation and vertical mixing. In regards to altered inflows, this collection of papers addresses how seagrass bed communities, incidence of some haptophyte harmful algal blooms, and biodiversity of intermittently flowing streams might respond. These papers also address factors that influence connectivity in wetlands, and in the case of a lake and its neighboring wetland, how connectivity between systems can profoundly affect ecosystem form and functioning. Finally, the effects of altered circulation and vertical mixing are addressed as they relate to the spread of some cyanobacteria blooms to higher latitudes. The reader of this collection of papers gains a better appreciation of how ecosystem form and functioning is influenced by hydrologic processes and can conclude that there is a need for continued research in this area to better understand the impacts of human population growth and climate change. </jats:p>

N2  - There is an increasing concern that a considerable fraction of engineered nanoparticles (ENs), including quantum dots (QDs), will eventually find their way into the marine environment and have negative impacts on plankton. As ENs enter the ocean, they will encounter extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from microbial sources before directly interacting with plankton cells. In this study, EPS harvested from four phytoplankton species, Amphora sp., Dunaliella tertiolecta, Phaeocystis globosa, and Thalassiosira pseudonana, were examined for potential interactions with CdSe nonfunctionalized and functionalized (carboxyl- and amine-) QDs in artificial seawater. Our results show that EPS do not reduce the solubility of QDs but rather decrease their stability. The degradation rate of QDs was positively correlated to the protein composition of EPS (defined by the ratio of protein/carbohydrate). Two approaches showed significant inhibition to the degradation of carboxyl-functionalized QDs: (1) the presence of an antioxidant, such as N-acetyl cysteine, and (2) absence of light. Owing to the complexity in evaluating integrated effects of QDs intrinsic properties and the external environmental factors that control the stability of QDs, conclusions must be based on a careful consideration of all these factors when attempting to evaluate the bioavailability of QDs and other ENs in the marine environments.

N2  - Ray-finned fishes make up half of all living vertebrate species. Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts, which include most commercially important fish species, several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology, and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes, the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses, which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints, result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems: specifically identifying elopomorphs (eels and tarpons) as the sister lineage of all other teleosts, providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts, and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the "bush at the top of the tree" that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes, we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences, but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, identifying this period as the "Second Age of Fishes."

N2  - BACKGROUND: Remipedia, a group of homonomously segmented, cave-dwelling, eyeless arthropods have been regarded as basal crustaceans in most early morphological and taxonomic studies. However, molecular sequence information together with the discovery of a highly differentiated brain led to a reconsideration of their phylogenetic position. Various conflicting hypotheses have been proposed including the claim for a basal position of Remipedia up to a close relationship with Malacostraca or Hexapoda. To provide new morphological characters that may allow phylogenetic insights, we have analyzed the architecture of the remipede brain in more detail using immunocytochemistry (serotonin, acetylated α-tubulin, synapsin) combined with confocal laser-scanning microscopy and image reconstruction techniques. This approach allows for a comprehensive neuroanatomical comparison with other crustacean and hexapod taxa. RESULTS: The dominant structures of the brain are the deutocerebral olfactory neuropils, which are linked by the olfactory globular tracts to the protocerebral hemiellipsoid bodies. The olfactory globular tracts form a characteristic chiasm in the center of the brain. In Speleonectes tulumensis, each brain hemisphere contains about 120 serotonin immunoreactive neurons, which are distributed in distinct cell groups supplying fine, profusely branching neurites to 16 neuropilar domains. The olfactory neuropil comprises more than 300 spherical olfactory glomeruli arranged in sublobes. Eight serotonin immunoreactive neurons homogeneously innervate the olfactory glomeruli. In the protocerebrum, serotonin immunoreactivity revealed several structures, which, based on their position and connectivity resemble a central complex comprising a central body, a protocerebral bridge, W-, X-, Y-, Z-tracts, and lateral accessory lobes. CONCLUSIONS: The brain of Remipedia shows several plesiomorphic features shared with other Mandibulata, such as deutocerebral olfactory neuropils with a glomerular organization, innervations by serotonin immunoreactive interneurons, and connections to protocerebral neuropils. Also, we provided tentative evidence for W-, X-, Y-, Z-tracts in the remipedian central complex like in the brain of Malacostraca, and Hexapoda. Furthermore, Remipedia display several synapomorphies with Malacostraca supporting a sister group relationship between both taxa. These homologies include a chiasm of the olfactory globular tract, which connects the olfactory neuropils with the lateral protocerebrum and the presence of hemiellipsoid bodies. Even though a growing number of molecular investigations unites Remipedia and Cephalocarida, our neuroanatomical comparison does not provide support for such a sister group relationship.

N2  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) produce a variety of low-frequency, short-duration, frequency-modulated calls. The differences in temporal patterns between two fin whale call types are described from long-term passive acoustic data collected intermittently between 2005 and 2011 at three locations across the eastern North Pacific: the Bering Sea, off Southern California, and in Canal de Ballenas in the northern Gulf of California. Fin whale calls were detected at all sites year-round, during all periods with recordings. At all three locations, 40-Hz calls peaked in June, preceding a peak in 20-Hz calls by 3-5 months. Monitoring both call types may provide a more accurate insight into the seasonal presence of fin whales across the eastern North Pacific than can be obtained from a single call type. The 40-Hz call may be associated with a foraging function, and temporal separation between 40- and 20-Hz calls may indicate the separation between predominately feeding behavior and other social interactions.

N2  - Sipuncula is a relatively small taxon with roughly 150 recognized species. Many species are geographically widespread or "cosmopolitan." The pelagosphera larvae of some species are estimated to spend several months in the plankton. However, recent molecular evidence suggests that many of the "cosmopolitan" species actually represent species-complexes, some not even monophyletic. Herein, we present data on three sipunculan species with different developmental modes that occur both in the Sea of Japan and in the Northeast Pacific. The development of the three species-Phascolosoma agassizii, Thysanocardia nigra, and Themiste pyroides-is exceptionally well studied in both regions of the Pacific. Significant differences have been observed between the two regions with respect to egg size, developmental mode, and developmental timing. In general, eggs are larger and development slower in the Northeast Pacific when compared with the Sea of Japan. These differences have been explained as a result of phenotypic plasticity exhibited under different environmental conditions, in particular temperature, but we show that the populations of all three species are also remarkably distinct genetically and that gene flow between the two regions is extremely unlikely. In Thysanocardia nigra, we even found two very distinct genetic lineages within the same location in the Northeast Pacific. The amount of genetic divergence between populations from the Sea of Japan and those from the Northeast Pacific is not correlated with developmental mode. Themiste pyroides, the species with the most abbreviated development, actually has the least degree of genetic divergence between the regions. Analyses of molecular variance show that the majority of the observed variation in all three species is between the regions. We conclude that all three "cosmopolitan" species actually represent complexes of cryptic or pseudo-cryptic species. These examples demonstrate that a solid taxonomic framework based on molecular and morphological evidence is a prerequisite for evaluating relationships between dispersal capabilities, species' ranges, and the connectivity of populations.

N2  - Fundamental knowledge of how biochars develop surface-charge and resistance to environmental degradation is crucial to their production for customized applications or understanding their functions in the environment. Two-dimensional perturbation-based correlation infrared spectroscopy (2D-PCIS) was used to study the biochar formation process in three taxonomically different plant biomass, under oxygen-limited conditions along a heat-treatment-temperature gradient (HTT; 200-650 °C). Results from 2D-PCIS pointed to the systematic, HTT-induced defragmenting of lignocellulose H-bonding network and demethylenation/demethylation, oxidation, or dehydroxylation/dehydrogenation of lignocellulose fragments as the primary reactions controlling biochar properties along the HTT gradient. The cleavage of OH(...)O-type H-bonds, oxidation of free primary hydroxyls to carboxyls (carboxylation; HTT ≤ 500 °C), and their subsequent dehydrogenation/dehydroxylation (HTT > 500 °C) controlled surface charge on the biochars; while the dehydrogenation of methylene groups, which yielded increasingly condensed structures (R-CH(2)-R →R═CH-R →R═C═R), controlled biochar recalcitrance. Variations in biochar properties across plant biomass type were attributable to taxa-specific transformations. For example, apparent inefficiencies in the cleavage of wood-specific H-bonds, and their subsequent oxidation to carboxyls, lead to lower surface charge in wood biochars (compared to grass biochars). Both nontaxa and taxa-specific transformations highlighted by 2D-PCIS could have significant implications for biochar functioning in fire-impacted or biochar-amended systems.

N2  - Chromera velia (Alveolata) is a close relative to apicomplexan parasites with a functional photosynthetic plastid. Even though C. velia has a primitive complement of pigments (lacks chlorophyll c) and uses an ancient type II form of RuBISCO, we found that its photosynthesis is very efficient with the ability to acclimate to a wide range of irradiances. C. velia maintain similar maximal photosynthetic rates when grown under continual light-limited (low light) or light-saturated (high light) conditions. This flexible acclimation to continuous light is provided by an increase of the chlorophyll content and photosystem II connectivity under light limited conditions and by an increase in the content of protective carotenoids together with stimulation of effective non-photochemical quenching under high light. C. velia is able to significantly increase photosynthetic rates when grown under a light-dark cycle with sinusoidal changes in light intensity. Photosynthetic activities were nonlinearly related to light intensity, with maximum performance measured at mid-morning. C. velia efficiently acclimates to changing irradiance by stimulation of photorespiration and non-photochemical quenching, thus avoiding any measurable photoinhibition. We suggest that the very high CO(2) assimilation rates under sinusoidal light regime are allowed by activation of the oxygen consuming process (possibly chlororespiration) that maintains high efficiency of RuBISCO (type II). Despite the overall simplicity of the C. velia photosynthetic system, it operates with great efficiency.

N2  - Effective collection of trace-level lanthanides and actinides is advantageous for recovery and recycling of valuable resources, environmental remediation, chemical separations, and in situ monitoring. Using isotopic tracers, we have evaluated a number of conventional and nanoporous sorbent materials for their ability to capture and remove selected lanthanides (Ce and Eu) and actinides (Th, Pa, U, and Np) from fresh and salt water systems. In general, the nanostructured materials demonstrated a higher level of performance and consistency. Nanoporous silica surface modified with 3,4-hydroxypyridinone provided excellent collection and consistency in both river water and seawater. The MnO(2) materials, in particular the high surface area small particle material, also demonstrated good performance. Other conventional sorbents typically performed at levels below the nanostructured sorbents and demonstrate a larger variability and matrix dependency.

N2  - This paper presents an integrated model of convective O(2)-transport, aerobic dive limits (ADL), and thermochemical data for oxygen binding to mutant myoglobin (Mb), used to quantify the impact of mutations in Mb on the dive limits of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). We find that wild-type Mb traits are only superior under specific behavioral and physiological conditions that critically prolong the ADL, action radius, and fitness of the seals. As an extreme example, the mutations in the conserved His-64 reduce ADL up to 14±2min for routine aerobic dives, whereas many other mutations are nearly neutral in terms of ADL and the inferred fitness. We also find that the cardiac system, the muscle O(2)-store, animal behavior (i.e. pre-dive ventilation), and the oxygen binding affinity of Mb, K(O(2)), have co-evolved to optimize dive duration at routine aerobic diving conditions, suggesting that such conditions are mostly selected upon in seals. The model is capable of roughly quantifying the physiological impact of single-protein mutations and thus bridges an important gap between animal physiology and molecular (protein) evolution.

N2  - Currently, we have little information concerning the involvement of β(3)-adrenergic receptors (AR) in cardiovascular regulation in fishes. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of β(3)-AR ligands on in vivo cardiovascular function in larval and adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). In adult fish, injection of BRL(37344) (β(3)-AR agonist) resulted in an increase in heart rate (f(H)) (~31%) while stroke volume (Sv) was reduced (-25.9%). Injection of SR(59230A) (β(3)-AR antagonist) and propranolol (β(1)/β(2)-AR antagonist) resulted in increases in dorsal aorta blood pressure (P(DA)) with differing effect on cardiac variables (f(H) and Sv). To confirm specificity of the results, BRL(37344) was injected following sequential injections of phentolamine (α(1)-AR antagonist), atropine (muscarinic antagonist), propranolol and SR(59230A). While phentolamine had no effect on BRL(37344), atropine completely abolished the influence of BRL(37344) on f(H), Sv and cardiac output (Q). In larval trout, BRL(37344) (10 and 100 μM) induced a significant concentration-dependent increase in f(H) while SR(59230A) (1 and 10 μM) and propranolol (1 and 10 μM) separately caused a significant concentration-dependent decrease. These data suggest that β(3)-ARs have an important role in regulation of cardiovascular function, and provide evidence for a potential interaction between muscarinic and adrenergic receptors in rainbow trout.

N2  - The resting and maximum in situ cardiac performance of Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) acclimated to 10, 4 and 0°C were measured at their respective acclimation temperatures, and when acutely exposed to temperature changes: i.e. hearts from 10°C fish cooled to 4°C, and hearts from 4°C fish measured at 10 and 0°C. Intrinsic heart rate (f(H)) decreased from 41 beats min(-1) at 10°C to 33 beats min(-1) at 4°C and 25 beats min(-1) at 0°C. However, this degree of thermal dependency was not reflected in maximal cardiac output (Q(max) values were ~44, ~37 and ~34 ml min(-1) kg(-1) at 10, 4 and 0°C, respectively). Further, cardiac scope showed a slight positive compensation between 4 and 0°C (Q(10)=1.7), and full, if not a slight over compensation between 10 and 4°C (Q(10)=0.9). The maximal performance of hearts exposed to an acute decrease in temperature (i.e. from 10 to 4°C and 4 to 0°C) was comparable to that measured for hearts from 4°C- and 0°C-acclimated fish, respectively. In contrast, 4°C-acclimated hearts significantly out-performed 10°C-acclimated hearts when tested at a common temperature of 10°C (in terms of both Q(max) and power output). Only minimal differences in cardiac function were seen between hearts stimulated with basal (5 nmol l(-1)) versus maximal (200 nmol l(-1)) levels of adrenaline, the effects of which were not temperature dependent. These results: (1) show that maximum performance of the isolated cod heart is not compromised by exposure to cold temperatures; and (2) support data from other studies, which show that, in contrast to salmonids, cod cardiac performance/myocardial contractility is not dependent upon humoral adrenergic stimulation.

N2  - Pinnipeds, that is true seals (Phocidae), eared seals (Otariidae), and walruses (Odobenidae), possess highly developed vibrissal systems for mechanoreception. They can use their vibrissae to detect and discriminate objects by direct touch. At least in Phocidae and Otariidae, the vibrissae can also be used to detect and analyse water movements. Here, we review what is known about this ability, known as hydrodynamic perception, in pinnipeds. Hydrodynamic perception in pinnipeds developed convergently to the hydrodynamic perception with the lateral line system in fish and the sensory hairs in crustaceans. So far two species of pinnipeds, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) representing the Phocidae and the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) representing the Otariidae, have been studied for their ability to detect local water movements (dipole stimuli) and to follow hydrodynamic trails, that is the water movements left behind by objects that have passed by at an earlier point in time. Both species are highly sensitive to dipole stimuli and can follow hydrodynamic trails accurately. In the individuals tested, California sea lions were clearly more sensitive to dipole stimuli than harbour seals, and harbour seals showed a superior trail following ability as compared to California sea lions. Harbour seals have also been shown to derive additional information from hydrodynamic trails, such as motion direction, size and shape of the object that caused the trail (California sea lions have not yet been tested). The peculiar undulated shape of the harbour seals' vibrissae appears to play a crucial role in trail following, as it suppresses self-generated noise while the animal is swimming.

N2  - The exponential growth of genetic resources is fueled by continued advances in genomic technologies and the adoption of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for population studies. Concomitant to these developments, there is growing need for rapid screening and subsequent genotyping of SNPs in non-model organisms. Here we provide a rapid and low-cost workflow utilizing high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) for nuclear marker development and genotyping of 774 Atlantic and Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) that is amendable to other species. Preliminary HRMA screening of amplicons (>290bp) for 10 nuclear loci revealed the presence of nucleotide polymorphisms, however, length and variability precluded diagnostic genotyping. Two variants of HRMA were therefore utilized to provide diagnostic genotyping assays. Short-amplicon HRMA (SA-HRMA), in which primers flank closely a SNP of interest, was identified as a low cost, rapid, closed-tube diagnostic genotyping assay that could distinguish between homozygous genotypes by ΔTm, and heterozygous genotypes by heteroduplex melting curve profiles. When the patterns of sequence variation were not suitable for SA-HRMA, unlabeled probe (UP)-HRMA was utilized. UP-HRMA has the advantage of being capable of genotyping multiple linked SNPs in a single closed-tube assay without Bayesian haplotype reconstruction, and can identify new SNPs while genotyping populations. Almost 37% of the SNPs genotyped via UP-HRMA were discovered while genotyping populations and not from preliminary screening. Analysis of swordfish in the North Atlantic (NA, n=419), South Atlantic (SA, n=296), and Mediterranean (MED, n=59) found no significant linkage disequilibrium. To assess whether deviations in HWE could be the result of genotyping error rather than population admixture only swordfish from reported spawning areas in the NA (n=49), MED (n=59), and SA (n=42) were analyzed and all loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Significant genetic differentiation (P<0.001) was identified among populations.

N2  - Known as Golden Algae in popular media, the harmful algal bloom causing organism Prymnesium parvum secretes increased amounts of toxic chemicals called prymnesins when stressed, resulting in major fish kills in Texas. Although many options exist for mitigation of blooms, a feasible protocol for control of blooms on large-scale impoundments has yet to be identified. Chemical control of P. parvum using six different enzyme inhibiting aquatic herbicides was explored in laboratory experiments. Of the six chemicals screened, one (flumioxazin) was selected for further study due to a significant decrease in P. parvum cell numbers with increasing chemical concentration. It was applied to natural plankton communities during in-situ experiments (Lake Granbury, Texas). The first experiment was conducted during a period of P. parvum bloom initiation (March) and the second experiment conducted during a post bloom period (April). Experiments were carried out in 20 L polycarbonate carboys covered in 30% shade cloth to simulate natural light, temperature and turbulence conditions. Through cell counts via light-microscopy, the chemical flumioxazin was found to cause significant decreases in P. parvum, but no significant differences in zooplankton abundance during the period of bloom initiation. However, significant decreases in adult copepods were observed during the post bloom period, with no significant decreases in P. parvum most likely due to decreased light penetration and inhibition of the photosensitive mode of action.

N2  - With over 50 percent of the US population residing in coastal areas, local decision makers are finding it increasingly difficult to protect critical natural resources, and facilitate the development of hazard-resilient communities. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the Texas coast. Rapid urban and suburban development has resulted in loss of critical habitats and key species while at the same time placing human populations in areas vulnerable to natural hazards. These problems are exacerbated within major population centers, particularly the Houston/Galveston area, where population growth, sprawling development patterns, and the alteration of hydrological systems have created some of the most vulnerable communities in the nation.

N2  - The perciform group Labroidei includes approximately 2600 species and comprises some of the most diverse and successful lineages of teleost fishes. Composed of four major clades, Cichlidae, Labridae (wrasses, parrotfishes, and weed whitings), Pomacentridae (damselfishes), and Embiotocidae (surfperches); labroids have been an icon for studies of biodiversity, adaptive radiation, and sexual selection. The success and diversification of labroids have been largely attributed to the presence of a major innovation in the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, pharyngognathy, which is hypothesized to increase feeding capacity and versatility. We present results of large-scale phylogenetic analyses and a survey of pharyngeal jaw functional morphology that allow us to examine the evolution of pharyngognathy in a historical context. Phylogenetic analyses were based on a sample of 188 acanthomorph (spiny-rayed fish) species, primarily percomorphs (perch-like fishes), and DNA sequence data collected from 10 nuclear loci that have been previously used to resolve higher level ray-finned fish relationships. Phylogenies inferred from this dataset using maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and species tree analyses indicate polyphyly of the traditional Labroidei and clearly separate Labridae from the remainder of the traditional labroid lineages (Cichlidae, Embiotocidae, and Pomacentridae). These three "chromide" families grouped within a newly discovered clade of 40 families and more than 4800 species (>27% of percomorphs and >16% of all ray-finned fishes), which we name Ovalentaria for its characteristic demersal, adhesive eggs with chorionic filaments. This fantastically diverse clade includes some of the most species-rich lineages of marine and freshwater fishes, including all representatives of the Cichlidae, Embiotocidae, Pomacentridae, Ambassidae, Gobiesocidae, Grammatidae, Mugilidae, Opistognathidae, Pholidichthyidae, Plesiopidae (including Notograptus), Polycentridae, Pseudochromidae, Atherinomorpha, and Blennioidei. Beyond the discovery of Ovalentaria, this study provides a surprising, but well-supported, hypothesis for a convict-blenny (Pholidichthys) sister group to the charismatic cichlids and new insights into the evolution of pharyngognathy. Bayesian stochastic mapping ancestral state reconstructions indicate that pharyngognathy has evolved at least six times in percomorphs, including four separate origins in members of the former Labroidei, one origin in the Centrogenyidae, and one origin within Beloniformes. Our analyses indicate that all pharyngognathous fishes have a mechanically efficient biting mechanism enabled by the muscular sling and a single lower jaw element. However, a major distinction exists between Labridae, which lacks the widespread, generalized percomorph pharyngeal biting mechanism, and all other pharyngognathous clades, which possess this generalized biting mechanism in addition to pharyngognathy. Our results reveal a remarkable history of pharyngognathy: far from a single origin, it appears to have evolved at least six times, and its status as a major evolutionary innovation is reinforced by it being a synapomorphy for several independent major radiations, including some of the most species rich and ecologically diverse percomorph clades of coral reef and tropical freshwater fishes, Labridae and Cichlidae.

N2  - Ontogenetic studies of vertebrate feeding performance can help address questions relevant to foraging ecology. Feeding morphology and performance can either limit access to food resources or open up new trophic niches in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Loggerhead sea turtles are long-lived vertebrates with complex life histories that are marked by an ontogenetic shift from an oceanic habitat to a coastal neritic habitat, and a transition from soft oceanic prey to hard, benthic prey. Although considered durophagous and strong biters, bite performance has not been measured in loggerheads, nor has the ontogeny of bite performance been characterized. In the present study, we collected measurements of bite force in loggerhead turtles from hatchlings to adults. When subadults reach the body size at which the ontogenetic shift occurs, their crushing capability is great enough for them to consume numerous species of hard benthic prey of small sizes. As loggerheads mature and bite performance increases, larger and harder benthic prey become accessible. Loggerhead bite performance eventually surpasses the crushing capability of other durophagous carnivores, thereby potentially reducing competition for hard benthic prey. The increasing bite performance and accompanying changes in morphology of the head and jaws are likely an effective mechanism for resource partitioning and decreasing trophic competition. Simultaneous measurements of body and head size and the use of non-linear reduced major axis regression show that bite force increases with significant positive allometry relative to body size (straight carapace length, straight carapace width and mass) and head size (head width, height and length). Simple correlation showed that all recorded morphometrics were good predictors of measured bite performance, but an AICc-based weighted regression showed that body size (straight carapace width followed by straight carapace length and mass, respectively) were more likely predictors of bite force than head size morphometrics (head width and head length).

N2  - Disasters like Hurricane Ike, as well as severe storms such as Allison, Katrina, and Rita are often referred to as "natural" disasters. Rather than being wholly "natural," however, these disasters result from the interaction among biophysical systems, human systems, and their built environment. Indeed, the emerging scientific consensus states that the damage incurred, in both human and financial terms, is largely due to human action or, more often, inaction (Mileti 1999). Communities in the United States and much of the world continue to develop and expand into high hazard areas. This contributes to increased hazard exposure and often results in the destruction of environmental resources such as wetlands, often increasing losses. In other words, many of the communities in our nation are becoming ever more vulnerable to "natural" hazards while simultaneously becoming less disaster resilient.

N2  - The physical habitat used during spawning may potentially be an important factor affecting reproductive output of broadcast spawning marine fishes, particularly for species with complex, substrate-oriented mating systems and behaviors, such as Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. We characterized the habitat use and behavior of spawning Atlantic cod at two locations off the coast of southwestern Iceland during a 2-d research cruise (15-16 April 2009). We simultaneously operated two different active hydroacoustic gear types, a split beam echosounder and a dual frequency imaging sonar (DIDSON), as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A total of five fish species were identified through ROV surveys: including cusk Brosme brosme, Atlantic cod, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, lemon sole Microstomus kitt, and Atlantic redfish Sebastes spp. Of the three habitats identified in the acoustic surveys, the transitional habitat between boulder/lava field and sand habitats was characterized by greater fish density and acoustic target strength compared to that of sand or boulder/lava field habitats independently. Atlantic cod were observed behaving in a manner consistent with published descriptions of spawning. Individuals were observed ascending 1-5 m into the water column from the bottom at an average vertical swimming speed of 0.20-0.25 m s(-1) and maintained an average spacing of 1.0-1.4 m between individuals. Our results suggest that cod do not choose spawning locations indiscriminately despite the fact that it is a broadcast spawning fish with planktonic eggs that are released well above the seafloor.

N2  - The presence of total mercury (Hg) in fish tissue and the potential associated health risks has become a global concern in marine ecosystems. Few studies have examined basin-scale variation in Hg accumulation in marine ecosystems, and determining if Hg concentrations in fish tissue vary across marine ecosystems is a key monitoring question. The present study evaluated Hg concentrations in red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) tissue across three regions of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, USA) and between two habitat types (oil and gas platforms and nonplatforms) within each region. Nitrogen (δ(15)N), carbon (δ(13)C), and sulfur (δ(34)S) stable isotopes were used to investigate ecological differences that may affect Hg concentrations among regions and between habitats. Mercury concentrations in red snapper tissue were positively correlated with fish total length. Regional differences in Hg concentrations were significant, with fish collected from Alabama having the highest concentrations and fish collected from Louisiana having the lowest. No significant difference existed in Hg concentrations between habitats, suggesting that association with platforms may not be a significant factor contributing to red snapper Hg concentrations. While δ(15)N did not differ significantly among the three regions, Texas red snapper were more enriched in δ(34)S and depleted in δ(13)C compared with Alabama and Louisiana red snapper. Although the majority of red snapper collected in the present study had Hg concentrations below safe consumption guidelines, regional differences suggest that spatially explicit monitoring programs may be important for basin-wide assessments.

N2  - <jats:p>The electrical characteristics of oxygen functionalized epitaxial graphene and Ti/Au metal contact interfaces were systematically investigated as a function of temperature. As the temperature was increased from 300 K to 673 K, the contact resistance and the sheet resistance decreased by 75% and 33%, respectively. The resistance of oxygen functionalized graphene vs temperature exhibited Arrhenius type behavior with activation energy of 38 meV. The results showed no hysteresis effects in resistance measurements over the temperatures studied here, suggesting the contact interfaces remain stable at high temperatures.</jats:p>

N2  - Much remains to be learned about single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses in natural systems, and the evolutionary relationships among them. One of the eight recognized families of ssDNA viruses is the Microviridae, a group of viruses infecting bacteria. In this study we used metagenomic analysis, genome assembly, and amplicon sequencing of purified ssDNA to show that bacteriophages belonging to the subfamily Gokushovirinae within the Microviridae are genetically diverse and widespread members of marine microbial communities. Metagenomic analysis of coastal samples from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and British Columbia, Canada, revealed numerous sequences belonging to gokushoviruses and allowed the assembly of five putative genomes with an organization similar to chlamydiamicroviruses. Fragment recruitment to these genomes from different metagenomic data sets is consistent with gokushovirus genotypes being restricted to specific oceanic regions. Conservation among the assembled genomes allowed the design of degenerate primers that target an 800 bp fragment from the gene encoding the major capsid protein. Sequences could be amplified from coastal temperate and subtropical waters, but not from samples collected from the Arctic Ocean, or freshwater lakes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most sequences were distantly related to those from cultured representatives. Moreover, the sequences fell into at least seven distinct evolutionary groups, most of which were represented by one of the assembled metagenomes. Our results greatly expand the known sequence space for gokushoviruses, and reveal biogeographic separation and new evolutionary lineages of gokushoviruses in the oceans.

N2  - Increasingly strict standards for harvest of oysters for the raw, half-shell market (designated as "white tag") should increase the proportion of oysters not meeting these standards (designated as "green tag"). Transplanting of green tag oysters into highsalinity  waters (>20 practical salinity units) was explored as a means of returning Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus levels to levels present on initial harvest. In summer 2011, oysters originally harvested in Louisiana were transplanted on two separate occasions (n  = 2) to two sites in Mississippi Sound, AL: Sandy Bay and Dauphin Island. Oysters were tested for V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus densities (by using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration enrichment method) after 2, 7, and 14 days deployed, with baseline samples taken (i)  at the time of original harvest and iced, (ii) from oysters refrigerated within 1 h of harvest at <45°F ([7.2°C] white tag) and, (iii) from oysters not refrigerated during the harvest trip (green tag) but refrigerated after an 8-h trip. White and green tag oysters were sampled ∼24  h on arrival in Bon Secour, AL, put on ice, and shipped for analysis. Among baseline samples, there were no significant differences in V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus densities, although the densities in the green tag oysters tended to be highest. After transplanting, V.  vulnificus densities were significantly highest on day 2, with no significant differences among any of the other days within a site. On day 2, Sandy Bay had significantly greater densities of V. vulnificus than the Dauphin Island site, but no other days differed from time zero.  For Vibrio parahaemolyticus, densities were greatest on day 2 and lowest at time zero, but this did not differ significantly from abundance on day 14. Average survival was 83.4% (± 3.13 SD), with no differences between sites. These preliminary results indicate that high-salinity  transplanting could be an effective method of converting green tag oysters to oysters suitable for "reharvest" as white tag oysters.

N2  - This paper analyses reefer cargo maritime shipping characteristics and recent development in South American East Coast ports. The geographical area studied goes from Punta Arenas (Chile) to Manaus (Brazil). The study main hypothesis is reefer shipping as a profitable market niche in spite of higher operation costs and a very demanding supply chain. The paper comprises three sections: the first one describes global reefer cargo transportation general characteristics. The second, reefer shipping in South American ports, focusing five main issues: (1) Cargo flows; (2) Ports infrastructure; (3) Post- Panamax vessels operation and its economies of scale; (4) Shippers and carriers' mergers and acquisitions processes and (5) Containerization process. Finally, it investigates the marketing relationship between shippers and shipping liners. The exploratory study was based on technical reports and statistics analysis, and interviews with industry executives, performing a multicase study. The general conclusions indicate that South American reefer market has concluded its containerization and concentration processes and showing a very good developing prospect for the region. Some experts consider that the market will keep increasing as a result of improved quality of products and enhancing cold logistics services providing, in spite of the international crisis, due to emergent markets buying and more demanding clients.

N2  - Continental runoff is a major source of freshwater, nutrients and terrigenous material to the Arctic Ocean. As such, it influences water column stratification, light attenuation, surface heating, gas exchange, biological productivity and carbon sequestration. Increasing river discharge and thawing permafrost suggest that the impacts of continental runoff on these processes are changing. Here, a new optical proxy was developed and implemented with remote sensing to determine the first pan-Arctic distribution of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (tDOM) and continental runoff in the surface Arctic Ocean. Retrospective analyses revealed connections between the routing of North American runoff and the recent freshening of the Canada Basin, and indicated a correspondence between climate-driven changes in river discharge and tDOM inventories in the Kara Sea. By facilitating the real-time, synoptic monitoring of tDOM and freshwater runoff in surface polar waters, this novel approach will help understand the manifestations of climate change in this remote region.

N2  - Quantum dots (QDs) are engineered nanoparticles (ENs) that have found increasing applications and shown great potential in drug delivery, biological imaging and industrial products. Knowledge of their stability, fate and transport in the aquatic environment is still lacking, including details of how these nanomaterials interact with marine phytoplankton. Here, we examined the toxicity of functionalized CdSe/ZnS QDs (amine- and carboxyl-) by exposing them for five days to Thalassiosira pseudonana (marine diatom) grown under different nutrient-conditions (enriched versus nitrogen-limited media). The released polysaccharides and proteins, the major components of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), were measured to assess their potential effects on the interactions between QDs and T. pseudonana. The partitioning of QDs was analyzed by monitoring the concentration of Cd in different size fractions of the cultures (i.e., filtrate, <0.22 μm and permeate, <3 kDa). We found that the Cd release of QDs in the T. pseudonana culture was dependent on the nutrient conditions and nature of QDs' surface coating. Both amine- and carboxyl-functionalized QDs exhibited higher rates of Cd release in N-limited cultures than in nutrient enriched cultures. The results also showed that amine-functionalized QDs aggregate with minimal Cd release, independent of nutrient conditions. Laser scanning confocal microscopy images confirmed that aggregates are composed of QDs and the culture matrix (EPS). In addition, both types of QDs showed limited toxicity to T. pseudonana. The increasing production of proteins induced by QDs suggests that extracellular proteins might be involved in the detoxification of QDs to T. pseudonana via the Cd release of QDs. Our results here demonstrated that EPS can play an ameliorating role in QD toxicity, fate and transport in the aquatic environment.

N2  - Multiple models of human metabolism have been reconstructed, but each represents only a subset of our knowledge. Here we describe Recon 2, a community-driven, consensus 'metabolic reconstruction', which is the most comprehensive representation of human metabolism that is applicable to computational modeling. Compared with its predecessors, the reconstruction has improved topological and functional features, including ∼2× more reactions and ∼1.7× more unique metabolites. Using Recon 2 we predicted changes in metabolite biomarkers for 49 inborn errors of metabolism with 77% accuracy when compared to experimental data. Mapping metabolomic data and drug information onto Recon 2 demonstrates its potential for integrating and analyzing diverse data types. Using protein expression data, we automatically generated a compendium of 65 cell type-specific models, providing a basis for manual curation or investigation of cell-specific metabolic properties. Recon 2 will facilitate many future biomedical studies and is freely available at http://humanmetabolism.org/.

N2  - <jats:p>Conversion of basal plane dislocations (BPDs) to threading edge dislocations in 8 and 4{degree sign} offcut SiC material has been studied in order to eliminate the nucleation source of Shockley-type stacking faults in the active region of bipolar devices. Ex situ and in situ growth interrupts were used to convert BPDs in the 8{degree sign} material, where conversion rates up to 98% were achieved for in situ interrupts in epilayers with doping &lt; 1x1016 cm-3. Complete spontaneous conversion of BPDs was found to be possible in 4{degree sign} offcut material after ~ 20 µm of epitaxial growth for both intentionally and unintentionally doped films.</jats:p>

N2  - Over the last few decades, advances in molecular techniques have led to the detection of strong geographic population structure and cryptic speciation in many benthic marine taxa, even those with long-lived pelagic larval stages. Polychaete annelids, in particular, generally show a high degree of population divergence, especially in mitochondrial genes. Rarely have molecular studies confirmed the presence of 'cosmopolitan' species. The amphinomid polychaete Hermodice carunculata was long considered the sole species within its genus, with a reported distribution throughout the Atlantic and adjacent basins. However, recent studies have indicated morphological differences, primarily in the number of branchial filaments, between the East and West Atlantic populations; these differences were invoked to re-instate Hermodice nigrolineata, formerly considered a junior synonym of H. carunculata. We utilized sequence data from two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S rDNA) markers and one nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) marker to examine the genetic diversity of Hermodice throughout its distribution range in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Guinea. Our analyses revealed generally low genetic divergences among collecting localities and between the East and West Atlantic, although phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial data indicate the presence of a private lineage in the Mediterranean Sea. A re-evaluation of the number of branchial filaments confirmed differences between East and West Atlantic populations; however, the differences were not diagnostic and did not reflect the observed genetic population structure. Rather, we suspect that the number of branchial filaments is a function of oxygen saturation in the environment. Our results do not support the distinction between H. carunculata in the West Atlantic and H. nigrolineata in the East Atlantic. Instead, they re-affirm the older notion that H. carunculata is a cohesive species with a broad distribution across the Atlantic Ocean.

N2  - Habitat use of juvenile southern flounder Paralichthys lethostigma was examined within a shallow estuarine seascape during June and July 2011 using acoustic telemetry. Fine-scale movement and habitat use of P. lethostigma was investigated with an acoustic positioning system placed in a seascape that varied in habitat type, physicochemical conditions and bathymetry. The use of different habitat types was examined with Euclidean distance-based analyses, and generalized additive models were used to determine the relative importance of habitat type relative to physicochemical conditions and bathymetry. Tracks of P. lethostigma ranged in distance between 1477 and 8582 m and speed was 4·2 ± 1·1 m min⁻¹ (mean ± s.e.) for all P. lethostigma combined. Depth, slope and habitat type had the most influence on P. lethostigma occurrence and deep sandy areas with shallow slopes were used most frequently. In addition, depth use by P. lethostigma was influenced by tidal cycles, indicating habitat use varies temporally and is dynamic. Finally, temperatures <30·5° C were used more than warmer waters within the study area. The results successfully identify movements by juvenile P. lethostigma, and indicate that definitions of essential habitats need to account for dynamics in habitat use.

N2  - Major fractions of radioiodine ((129)I) are associated with natural organic matter (NOM) in the groundwater and surface soils of the Savannah River Site (SRS). Electrospray ionization coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) was applied to elucidate the interactions between inorganic iodine species (iodide and iodate) and a fulvic acid (FA) extracted from a SRS surface soil. Iodate is likely reduced to reactive iodine species by the lignin- and tannin-like compounds or the carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM), during which condensed aromatics and lignin-like compounds were generated. Iodide is catalytically oxidized into reactive iodine species by peroxides, while FA is oxidized by peroxides into more aliphatic and less aromatic compounds. Only 9% of the total identified organo-iodine compounds derived from molecules originally present in the FA, whereas most were iodine binding to newly-produced compounds. The resulting iodinated molecules were distributed in three regions in the van Krevelen diagrams, denoting unsaturated hydrocarbons, lignin and protein. Moreover, characteristics of these organo-iodine compounds, such as their relatively low O/C ratios (<0.2 or <0.4) and yet some degree of un-saturation close to that of lignin, have multiple important environmental implications concerning possibly less sterically-hindered aromatic ring system for iodine to get access to and a lower hydrophilicity of the molecules thus to retard their migration in the natural aquatic systems. Lastly, ~69% of the identified organo-iodine species contains nitrogen, which is presumably present as NH2 or HNCOR groups and a ring-activating functionality to favor the electrophilic substitution. The ESI-FTICR-MS technique provides novel evidence to better understand the reactivity and scavenging properties of NOM towards radioiodine and possible influence of NOM on (129)I migration.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Remipedia were initially seen as a primitive taxon within Pancrustacea based on characters considered ancestral, such as the homonomously segmented trunk. Meanwhile, several morphological and molecular studies proposed a more derived position of Remipedia within Pancrustacea, including a sister group relationship to Hexapoda. Because of these conflicting hypotheses, fresh data are crucial to contribute new insights into euarthropod phylogeny. The architecture of individually identifiable serotonin-immunoreactive neurons has successfully been used for phylogenetic considerations in Euarthropoda. Here, we identified neurons in three species of Remipedia with an antiserum against serotonin and compared our findings to reconstructed ground patterns in other euarthropod taxa. Additionally, we traced neurite connectivity and neuropil outlines using antisera against acetylated α-tubulin and synapsin. RESULTS: The ventral nerve cord of Remipedia displays a typical rope-ladder-like arrangement of separate metameric ganglia linked by paired longitudinally projecting connectives. The peripheral projections comprise an intersegmental nerve, consisting of two branches that fuse shortly after exiting the connectives, and the segmental anterior and posterior nerve. The distribution and morphology of serotonin-immunoreactive interneurons in the trunk segments is highly conserved within the remipede species we analyzed, which allows for the reconstruction of a ground pattern: two posterior and one anterior pair of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons that possess a single contralateral projection. Additionally, three pairs of immunoreactive neurons are found in the medial part of each hemiganglion. In one species (Cryptocorynetes haptodiscus), the anterior pair of immunoreactive neurons is missing. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomy of the remipede ventral nerve cord with its separate metameric ganglia mirrors the external morphology of the animal's trunk. The rope-ladder-like structure and principal architecture of the segmental ganglia in Remipedia corresponds closely to that of other Euarthropoda. A comparison of the serotonin-immunoreactive cell arrangement of Remipedia to reconstructed ground patterns of major euarthropod taxa supports a homology of the anterior and posterior neurons in Pancrustacea. These neurons in Remipedia possess unbranched projections across the midline, pointing towards similarities to the hexapod pattern. Our findings are in line with a growing number of phylogenetic investigations proposing Remipedia to be a rather derived crustacean lineage that perhaps has close affinities to Hexapoda.

The Landau-level transitions are detected in reflection configuration at oblique incidence for wavenumbers below, across and above the silicon carbide reststrahlen range. Small Landau-level transition features are enhanced across the silicon carbide reststrahlen range due to surface-guided wave coupling with the electronic Landau-level transitions in the graphene layer. We analyze the spectral and magnetic-field dependencies of the coupled resonances, and compare our findings with previously reported Landau-level transitions measured in transmission configuration [4,5,6]. Additional features resemble transitions previously assigned to bilayer inclusion [21], as well as graphite [15]. We discuss a model description to account for the electromagnetic polarizability of the graphene layers, and which is sufficient for quantitative model calculation of the optical-Hall effect data.</jats:p>

N2  - Hypocrellin B (Hyp B), a perylenequinone naturally present in Hypocrella bambusae, is commonly used to treat a variety of diseases. Its versatile role in different biomedical applications necessitates a thorough investigation of its interaction with different biomolecules, particularly enzymes. To address this need, the binding mode of Hyp B to myoglobin (Mb) was studied using UV-visible absorption, emission, and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopies, as well as flexible docking simulations. Analyses of the absorbance and fluorescence data establish that Hyp B quenches tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence via the formation of two unique ground-state complexes on the surface of Mb, with one site being more energetically preferred than the other (the fraction of fluorophores accessible by Hyp B is 0.32). Molecular modeling simulations demonstrate preferential Hyp B binding at the Tyr103 site first, followed by the Trp7 site. In both cases, a ground-state complex is generated through H-bonding interaction between Hyp B and the respective residues, with the Tyr103 complex being more stable than that of the Trp7 complex. Synchronous fluorescence measurements indicate that the microenvironment surrounding Trp7 becomes more hydrophilic upon Hyp B interaction. This is evidenced by a red-shift of the band associated with this residue, while that of Tyr103 remains the same. Electrostatic potential surfaces reveal a more pronounced shift in electron density of Trp7 upon Hyp B binding compared to Tyr103. The binding constant of Hyp B to Mb is 1.21×10(5)M(-1), suggesting a relatively strong interaction between the ligand and enzyme.

N2  - Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are economically important pathogens of plants and animals, and are widespread in oceans; yet, the diversity and evolutionary relationships among marine ssDNA viruses remain largely unknown. Here we present the results from a metagenomic study of composite samples from temperate (Saanich Inlet, 11 samples; Strait of Georgia, 85 samples) and subtropical (46 samples, Gulf of Mexico) seawater. Most sequences (84%) had no evident similarity to sequenced viruses. In total, 608 putative complete genomes of ssDNA viruses were assembled, almost doubling the number of ssDNA viral genomes in databases. These comprised 129 genetically distinct groups, each represented by at least one complete genome that had no recognizable similarity to each other or to other virus sequences. Given that the seven recognized families of ssDNA viruses have considerable sequence homology within them, this suggests that many of these genetic groups may represent new viral families. Moreover, nearly 70% of the sequences were similar to one of these genomes, indicating that most of the sequences could be assigned to a genetically distinct group. Most sequences fell within 11 well-defined gene groups, each sharing a common gene. Some of these encoded putative replication and coat proteins that had similarity to sequences from viruses infecting eukaryotes, suggesting that these were likely from viruses infecting eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton.

N2  - Spiny-rayed fishes, or acanthomorphs, comprise nearly one-third of all living vertebrates. Despite their dominant role in aquatic ecosystems, the evolutionary history and tempo of acanthomorph diversification is poorly understood. We investigate the pattern of lineage diversification in acanthomorphs by using a well-resolved time-calibrated phylogeny inferred from a nuclear gene supermatrix that includes 520 acanthomorph species and 37 fossil age constraints. This phylogeny provides resolution for what has been classically referred to as the "bush at the top" of the teleost tree, and indicates acanthomorphs originated in the Early Cretaceous. Paleontological evidence suggests acanthomorphs exhibit a pulse of morphological diversification following the end Cretaceous mass extinction; however, the role of this event on the accumulation of living acanthomorph diversity remains unclear. Lineage diversification rates through time exhibit no shifts associated with the end Cretaceous mass extinction, but there is a global decrease in lineage diversification rates 50 Ma that occurs during a period when morphological disparity among fossil acanthomorphs increases sharply. Analysis of clade-specific shifts in diversification rates reveal that the hyperdiversity of living acanthomorphs is highlighted by several rapidly radiating lineages including tunas, gobies, blennies, snailfishes, and Afro-American cichlids. These lineages with high diversification rates are not associated with a single habitat type, such as coral reefs, indicating there is no single explanation for the success of acanthomorphs, as exceptional bouts of diversification have occurred across a wide array of marine and freshwater habitats.

N2  - Understanding how natural and anthropogenic drivers affect extant food webs is critical to predicting the impacts of climate change and habitat alterations on ecosystem dynamics. In the Florida Everglades, seasonal reductions in freshwater flow and precipitation lead to annual migrations of aquatic taxa from marsh habitats to deep-water refugia in estuaries. The timing and intensity of freshwater reductions, however, will be modified by ongoing ecosystem restoration and predicted climate change. Understanding the importance of seasonally pulsed resources to predators is critical to predicting the impacts of management and climate change on their populations. As with many large predators, however, it is difficult to determine to what extent predators like bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in the coastal Everglades make use of prey pulses currently. We used passive acoustic telemetry to determine whether shark movements responded to the pulse of marsh prey. To investigate the possibility that sharks fed on marsh prey, we modelled the predicted dynamics of stable isotope values in bull shark blood and plasma under different assumptions of temporal variability in shark diets and physiological dynamics of tissue turnover and isotopic discrimination. Bull sharks increased their use of upstream channels during the late dry season, and although our previous work shows long-term specialization in the diets of sharks, stable isotope values suggested that some individuals adjusted their diets to take advantage of prey entering the system from the marsh, and as such this may be an important resource for the nursery. Restoration efforts are predicted to increase hydroperiods and marsh water levels, likely shifting the timing, duration and intensity of prey pulses, which could have negative consequences for the bull shark population and/or induce shifts in behaviour. Understanding the factors influencing the propensity to specialize or adopt more flexible trophic interactions will be an important step in fully understanding the ecological role of predators and how ecological roles may vary with environmental and anthropogenic changes.

N2  - Psammogammarus lucayensis sp. nov. is described from anchialine pools on Little Iguana Cay (Exuma Cays, Great Bahama Bank). It can be easily distinguished from the other 14 members of the genus by the combination of: 1) carpus of G2 longer than broad; 2) male G2 palm margin non-excavated, evenly convex and devoid of strong mid-palmar robust setae; 3) basis of P7 with subparallel margins; 4) armature arrangement of ventral margin of epimeral plates as 0-2-3; 5) posteroventral angle of epimeral plate III strongly produced; 6) protopod of U2 with distomedial angle armed with comb of 3-4 robust setae; 7) U3 endopod as long as exp1; and 8) telson with robust setae on tip. The generic diagnosis is amended in order to allow the precise characterization of members of Psammogammarus compared to other eriopisids.

N2  - Foraminifera responded to both heavy and light oiling of marshes relative to unoiled control sites by changes to both standing stock and depth of habitation (DOH) in sediment following the 2010 Macondo well blowout. Push cores were taken from the middle marsh at sites classified as unoiled, lightly oiled, and heavily oiled based on concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ([TPAH]). Cores were sliced and stained with rose Bengal to detect live specimens of foraminifera. Short-term, sediment-mixing depths were determined using the penetration depths of excess (234)Th, and sedimentary organic carbon and carbonate were measured to distinguish depositional environments. Marsh foraminifera reacted to the highest oil concentration (5,000-18,000 ng/g of TPAH) by reducing standing stock and shortening the DOH compared with the control sites. At a second, less heavily oiled site, foraminifera responded with a shallower DOH, but with a boom in standing stock. Deformed, dead foraminifera occurred in all heavily oiled cores-but not elsewhere. Live foraminifera responded with a population boom at lightly oiled sites with [TPAH] near 1,100 ng/g. Changes in standing stock and DOH with [TPAH] suggest disturbance to the marsh food web, apparently due to oil pollution, and support the use of foraminifera as sentinel species.

N2  - Prymnesium parvum is a haptophyte alga that forms toxic, fish-killing blooms in a variety of brackish coastal and inland waters. Its abundance and toxicity are suppressed by ammonium additions in laboratory cultures and aquaculture ponds. In a cove of a large reservoir (Lake Granbury, Texas, USA) with recurring, seasonal blooms of P. parvum, ammonium additions were tested in mesocosm enclosures for their ability to suppress blooms and their effects on non-target planktonic organisms. One experiment occurred prior to the peak abundance of a P. parvum bloom in the cove, and one encompassed the peak abundance and decline of the bloom. During 21-day experiments, weekly doses raised ammonium concentrations by either 10 or 40 μM. The added ammonium accumulated in experimental mesocosms, with little uptake by biota or other losses. Effects of ammonium additions generally increased over the course of the experiments. The higher ammonium dose suppressed the abundance and toxicity of P. parvum. The biomass of non-haptophyte algae was stimulated by ammonium additions, while positive, negative and neutral effects on zooplankton taxa were observed. Low ammonium additions insufficient to control P. parvum exacerbated its harmful effects. Our results indicate a potential for mitigating blooms of P. parvum with sufficient additions of ammonium to coves of larger lakes. However, factors excluded from mesocosms, such as dilution of ammonium by water exchange and sediment ammonium uptake, could reduce the effectiveness of such additions, and they would entail a risk of eutrophication from the added nitrogen.

N2  - The geochemical transport and fate of radioiodine depends largely on its chemical speciation that is greatly affected by environmental factors. This study reports, for the first time, the speciation of stable and radioactive iodine in the groundwater from the Hanford Site. Iodate was the dominant species and accounted for up to 84% of the total iodine present. The alkaline pH (pH ∼ 8) and predominantly oxidizing environment may have prevented reduction of the iodate. In addition, groundwater samples were found to have large amounts of calcite precipitate which were likely formed as a result of CO2 degassing during removal from the deep subsurface (>70m depth). Further analyses indicated that between 7 and 40% of the dissolved (127)I and (129)I that was originally in the groundwater had coprecipitated in the calcite. Iodate was the main species incorporated into calcite and this incorporation process could be impeded by elevating the pH and decreasing ionic strength in groundwater. This study provides critical information for predicting the long-term fate and transport of (129)I. Furthermore, the common sampling artifact resulting in the precipitation of calcite by degassing CO2, had the unintended consequence of providing insight into a potential solution for the in situ remediation of groundwater (129)I.

N2  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and heterotrophic bacteria are highly diverse components of the ocean system, and their interactions are key in regulating the biogeochemical cycles of major elements. How chemical and phylogenetic diversity are linked remains largely unexplored to date. To investigate interactions between bacterial diversity and DOM, we followed the response of natural bacterial communities to two sources of phytoplankton-derived DOM over six bacterial generation times in continuous cultures. Analyses of total hydrolysable neutral sugars and amino acids, and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed large differences in the chemical composition of the two DOM sources. According to 454 pyrosequences of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes, diatom-derived DOM sustained higher levels of bacterial richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity than cyanobacteria-derived DOM. These distinct community structures were, however, not associated with specific taxa. Grazing pressure affected bacterial community composition without changing the overall pattern of bacterial diversity levels set by DOM. Our results demonstrate that resource composition can shape several facets of bacterial diversity without influencing the phylogenetic composition of bacterial communities, suggesting functional redundancy at different taxonomic levels for the degradation of phytoplankton-derived DOM.

N2  - Most subsurface environmental radioactivity contamination is expected to eventually resurface in riparian zones, or wetlands. There are a number of extremely sharp biogeochemical interfaces in wetlands that could alter radionuclide speciation and promote accumulation. The objective of this study was to determine if a wetland concentrated (129)I emanating from a former waste disposal basin located on the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA. Additionally, studies were conducted to evaluate the role of sediment organic matter in immobilizing the radioiodine. Groundwater samples were collected along a 0.7-km transect away from the seepage basin and in the downstream wetlands. The samples were analyzed for (129)I speciation (iodide (I(-)), iodate (IO3(-)), and organo-I). Groundwater (129)I concentrations in many locations in the wetlands (as high as 59.9 Bq L(-1)(129)I) were greatly elevated with respect to the source term (5.9 Bq L(-1)(129)I). (129)I concentration profiles in sediment cores were closely correlated to organic matter concentrations (r(2) = 0.992; n = 5). While the sediment organic matter promoted the uptake of (129)I to the wetland sediment, it also promoted the formation of a soluble organic fraction: 74% of the wetland groundwater (129)I could pass through a 1 kDa (<1 nm) membrane and only 26% of the (129)I was colloidal. Of that fraction that could pass through a 1 kDa membrane, 39% of the (129)I was organo-I. Therefore, while wetlands may be highly effective at immobilizing aqueous (129)I, they may also promote the formation of a low-molecular-weight organic species that does not partition to sediments. This study provides a rare example of radioactivity concentrations increasing rather than decreasing as it migrates from a point source and brings into question assumptions in risk models regarding continuous dilution of released contaminants.

N2  - Ocean ambient noise is well studied in the North Pacific and North Atlantic but is poorly described for most of the worlds' oceans. Calibrated passive acoustic recordings were collected during 2009-2010 at seven locations in the central and western tropical and subtropical Pacific. Monthly and hourly mean power spectra (15-1000 Hz) were calculated in addition to their skewness, kurtosis, and percentile distributions. Overall, ambient noise at these seven sites was 10-20 dB lower than reported recently for most other locations in the North Pacific. At frequencies <100 Hz, spectrum levels were equivalent to those predicted for remote or light shipping. Noise levels in the 40 Hz band were compared to the presence of nearby and distant ships as reported to the World Meteorological Organization Voluntary Observing Ship Scheme (VOS) project. There was a positive, but nonsignificant correlation between distant shipping and low frequency noise (at 40 Hz). There was a seasonal variation in ambient noise at frequencies >200 Hz with higher levels recorded in the winter than in the summer. Several species of baleen whales, humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), and fin (B. physalus) whales, also contributed seasonally to ambient noise in characteristic frequency bands.

N2  - Metabolic rate determines the physiological and life-history performances of ectotherms. Thus, the extent to which such rates are sensitive and plastic to environmental perturbation is central to an organism's ability to function in a changing environment. Little is known of long-term metabolic plasticity and potential for metabolic adaptation in marine ectotherms exposed to elevated pCO2. Consequently, we carried out a series of in situ transplant experiments using a number of tolerant and sensitive polychaete species living around a natural CO2 vent system. Here, we show that a marine metazoan (i.e. Platynereis dumerilii) was able to adapt to chronic and elevated levels of pCO2. The vent population of P. dumerilii was physiologically and genetically different from nearby populations that experience low pCO2, as well as smaller in body size. By contrast, different populations of Amphiglena mediterranea showed marked physiological plasticity indicating that adaptation or acclimatization are both viable strategies for the successful colonization of elevated pCO2 environments. In addition, sensitive species showed either a reduced or increased metabolism when exposed acutely to elevated pCO2. Our findings may help explain, from a metabolic perspective, the occurrence of past mass extinction, as well as shed light on alternative pathways of resilience in species facing ongoing ocean acidification.

N2  - Pulse disturbances and habitat patch size can determine community composition independently or in concert, and may be particularly influential on small spatial scales for organisms with low mobility. In a field experiment, we investigated whether the effects of a pulsed disturbance that simulated a grazing event varied with habitat patch size. We focused on the short-term responses of multiple co-occurring emergent salt marsh arthropods with differing levels of mobility and dispersal potential. As part of a marsh restoration project, two types of emergent marsh structures were created: small circular mounds (0.5 m diameter) separated by several meters of aquatic habitat, and larger, elongated terraces (>50 m long). Study plots (0.25 m(2)) were established on both structures; in a subset of plots, we simulated a pulsed grazing disturbance event by clipping the aboveground tissue of emergent plants, primarily Spartina alterniflora. At the end of the two-month recovery period, Ischnodemus (Hemiptera: Blissidae) density was over 50% lower in disturbed treatments within both large (terrace) and small (mound) patches. Predatory spider treatment responses were similar to Ischnodemus responses, suggesting a trophic relationship between those two arthropod groups. Alternatively, spiders may have been directly affected by the loss of shelter in the disturbed plots. Prokelisia (Homoptera: Delphacidae), which are generally more mobile than Ischnodemus, were not affected by disturbance treatment or by patch size, suggesting the potential for rapid recolonization following disturbance. Larval stem borers decreased by an order of magnitude in disturbed plots, but only in the large patches. In general, the disturbance effects of vegetation removal on arthropod density and community composition were stronger than patch size effects, and there were few interactions between pulsed disturbance and patch size. Rather, emergent marsh arthropod responses to disturbance and habitat area treatments were linked to the dispersal potential and mobility of each individual taxon.

N2  - Time-series data collected over a four-year period were used to characterize patterns of abundance for pelagic fishes in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) before (2007-2009) and after (2010) the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Four numerically dominant pelagic species (blackfin tuna, blue marlin, dolphinfish, and sailfish) were included in our assessment, and larval density of each species was lower in 2010 than any of the three years prior to the oil spill, although larval abundance in 2010 was often statistically similar to other years surveyed. To assess potential overlap between suitable habitat of pelagic fish larvae and surface oil, generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed to evaluate the influence of ocean conditions on the abundance of larvae from 2007-2009. Explanatory variables from GAMs were then linked to environmental data from 2010 to predict the probability of occurrence for each species. The spatial extent of surface oil overlapped with early life habitat of each species, possibly indicating that the availability of high quality habitat was affected by the DH oil spill. Shifts in the distribution of spawning adults is another factor known to influence the abundance of larvae, and the spatial occurrence of a model pelagic predator (blue marlin) was characterized over the same four-year period using electronic tags. The spatial extent of oil coincided with areas used by adult blue marlin from 2007-2009, and the occurrence of blue marlin in areas impacted by the DH oil spill was lower in 2010 relative to pre-spill years.

N2  - Marine mammals exhibit multi-level adaptations, from cellular biochemistry to behavior, that maximize aerobic dive duration. A dive response during aerobic dives enables the efficient use of blood and muscle oxygen stores, but it is exercise modulated to maximize the aerobic dive limit at different levels of exertion. Blood volume and concentrations of blood hemoglobin and muscle myoglobin are elevated and serve as a significant oxygen store that increases aerobic dive duration. However, myoglobin is not homogeneously distributed in the locomotory muscles and is highest in areas that produce greater force and consume more oxygen during aerobic swimming. Muscle fibers are primarily fast and slow twitch oxidative with elevated mitochondrial volume densities and enhanced oxidative enzyme activities that are highest in areas that produce more force generation. Most of the muscle mitochondria are interfibriller and homogeneously distributed. This reduces the diffusion distance between mitochondria and helps maintain aerobic metabolism under hypoxic conditions. Mitochondrial volume densities and oxidative enzyme activities are also elevated in certain organs such as liver, kidneys, and stomach. Hepatic and renal function along with digestion and assimilation continue during aerobic dives to maintain physiological homeostasis. Most ATP production comes from aerobic fat metabolism in carnivorous marine mammals. Glucose is derived mostly from gluconeogenesis and is conserved for tissues such as red blood cells and the central nervous system. Marine mammals minimize the energetic cost of swimming and diving through body streamlining, efficient, lift-based propulsive appendages, and cost-efficient modes of locomotion that reduce drag and take advantage of changes in buoyancy with depth. Most dives are within the animal's aerobic dive limit, which maximizes time underwater and minimizes recovery time at the surface. The result of these adaptations is increased breath-hold duration and enhanced foraging ability that maximizes energy intake and minimizes energy output while making aerobic dives to depth. These adaptations are the long, evolutionary legacy of an aquatic lifestyle that directly affects the fitness of marine mammal species for different diving abilities and environments.

N2  - Since its description from the Galapagos Rift in the mid-1980s, Archinome rosacea has been recorded at hydrothermal vents in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Only recently was a second species described from the Pacific Antarctic Ridge. We inferred the identities and evolutionary relationships of Archinome representatives sampled from across the hydrothermal vent range of the genus, which is now extended to cold methane seeps. Species delimitation using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) recovered up to six lineages, whereas concatenated datasets (COI, 16S, 28S and ITS1) supported only four or five of these as clades. Morphological approaches alone were inconclusive to verify the identities of species owing to the lack of discrete diagnostic characters. We recognize five Archinome species, with three that are new to science. The new species, designated based on molecular evidence alone, include: Archinome levinae n. sp., which occurs at both vents and seeps in the east Pacific, Archinome tethyana n. sp., which inhabits Atlantic vents and Archinome jasoni n. sp., also present in the Atlantic, and whose distribution extends to the Indian and southwest Pacific Oceans. Biogeographic connections between vents and seeps are highlighted, as are potential evolutionary links among populations from vent fields located in the east Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and Atlantic and Indian Oceans; the latter presented for the first time.

N2  - Cichlid fishes are a key model system in the study of adaptive radiation, speciation and evolutionary developmental biology. More than 1600 cichlid species inhabit freshwater and marginal marine environments across several southern landmasses. This distributional pattern, combined with parallels between cichlid phylogeny and sequences of Mesozoic continental rifting, has led to the widely accepted hypothesis that cichlids are an ancient group whose major biogeographic patterns arose from Gondwanan vicariance. Although the Early Cretaceous (ca 135 Ma) divergence of living cichlids demanded by the vicariance model now represents a key calibration for teleost molecular clocks, this putative split pre-dates the oldest cichlid fossils by nearly 90 Myr. Here, we provide independent palaeontological and relaxed-molecular-clock estimates for the time of cichlid origin that collectively reject the antiquity of the group required by the Gondwanan vicariance scenario. The distribution of cichlid fossil horizons, the age of stratigraphically consistent outgroup lineages to cichlids and relaxed-clock analysis of a DNA sequence dataset consisting of 10 nuclear genes all deliver overlapping estimates for crown cichlid origin centred on the Palaeocene (ca 65-57 Ma), substantially post-dating the tectonic fragmentation of Gondwana. Our results provide a revised macroevolutionary time scale for cichlids, imply a role for dispersal in generating the observed geographical distribution of this important model clade and add to a growing debate that questions the dominance of the vicariance paradigm of historical biogeography.

N2  - Bio-energetic models used to characterize an animal's energy budget require the accurate estimate of different variables such as the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and the heat increment of feeding (HIF). In this study, we estimated the in air RMR of wild juvenile South American fur seals (SAFS; Arctocephalus australis) temporarily held in captivity by measuring oxygen consumption while at rest in a postabsorptive condition. HIF, which is an increase in metabolic rate associated with digestion, assimilation and nutrient interconversion, was estimated as the difference in resting metabolic rate between the postabsorptive condition and the first 3.5h postprandial. As data were hierarchically structured, linear mixed effect models were used to compare RMR measures under both physiological conditions. Results indicated a significant increase (61%) for the postprandial RMR compared to the postabsorptive condition, estimated at 17.93±1.84 and 11.15±1.91mL O2 min(-1)kg(-1), respectively. These values constitute the first estimation of RMR and HIF in this species, and should be considered in the energy budgets for juvenile SAFS foraging at-sea.

N2  - Atomic-layer 2D crystals have unique properties that can be significantly modified through interaction with an underlying support. For epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001), the interface strongly influences the electronic properties of the overlaying graphene. We demonstrate a novel combination of x-ray scattering and spectroscopy for studying the complexities of such a buried interface structure. This approach employs x-ray standing wave-excited photoelectron spectroscopy in conjunction with x-ray reflectivity to produce a highly resolved chemically sensitive atomic profile for the terminal substrate bilayers, interface, and graphene layers along the SiC[0001] direction.

N2  - Changes in geomorphology of estuaries are common following major perpetuations such as hurricanes and may have profound impacts on biological systems. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 created a new pass, called Katrina Cut, halving Dauphin Island in Mobile Bay, Alabama. Significant decline in oyster population at Cedar Point Reef, the primary oyster harvest grounds in Mobile Bay, had persisted since then until the Cut was artificially closed in 2010. A bio-physical model for hydrodynamics and oyster larval transport was used to evaluate two potential mechanisms responsible for oyster population declines: salinity changes in the context of oyster habitat suitability and retention of oyster larvae. The model results revealed that when open Katrina Cut increased salinity at Cedar Point Reef. During high freshwater discharge, in particular, water exchange through Katrina Cut increased the bottom salinity from <5 psu to well over 15 (sometimes >20) psu during the tropic tides. Elevated salinities are associated with greater predation on oysters and higher disease incidence. The presence of the Katrina Cut also reduced larval retention in the spawning area regardless of tidal or river discharge conditions. We conclude that closing the Cut likely improved conditions for oysters within Mobile Bay and eastern Mississippi Sound and that these improved conditions have contributed to increased oyster landings.

N2  - Nitzschia sp. (Bacillariophyceae) was grown under temperature and photoperiods mimicking those, typical during summer, spring/fall and winter conditions in the southern United States, and using five silicate (Si) concentrations. In general, higher Si concentrations resulted in higher growth rates in summer and spring/fall conditions and lower organic content. Si-deficient Nitzschia sp. had higher levels of neutral lipid compared to those growing in Si replete media. Under summer conditions, the proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was relatively stable compared with spring/fall and winter conditions, and the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was low. In the winter condition, SFA and MUFA showed a gradient of decreasing abundance while PUFA gradients increased with increasing Si concentrations in the medium. Cumulative productivity (optimization of growth and lipid content) would be best in the spring/fall but less so in the other conditions for this strain of Nitzschia sp.

N2  - Zero forcing number has recently become an interesting graph parameter studied in its own right since its introduction by the “AIM Minimum Rank-Special Graphs Work Group”, whereas metric dimension is a well-known graph parameter. We investigate the metric dimension and the zero forcing number of some line graphs by first determining the metric dimension and the zero forcing number of the line graphs of wheel graphs and the bouquet of circles. We prove that Z(G) < 2Z(L(G)) for a simple and connected graph G. Further, we show that Z(G) < Z(L(G)) when G is a tree or when G contains a Hamiltonian path and has a certain number of edges. We compare the metric dimension with the zero forcing number of a line graph by demonstrating a couple of inequalities between the two parameters. We end by stating some open problems.

N2  - Over 95% of all metazoan (animal) species comprise the "invertebrates," but very few genomes from these organisms have been sequenced. We have, therefore, formed a "Global Invertebrate Genomics Alliance" (GIGA). Our intent is to build a collaborative network of diverse scientists to tackle major challenges (e.g., species selection, sample collection and storage, sequence assembly, annotation, analytical tools) associated with genome/transcriptome sequencing across a large taxonomic spectrum. We aim to promote standards that will facilitate comparative approaches to invertebrate genomics and collaborations across the international scientific community. Candidate study taxa include species from Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, Placozoa, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, Annelida, Bryozoa, and Platyhelminthes, among others. GIGA will target 7000 noninsect/nonnematode species, with an emphasis on marine taxa because of the unrivaled phyletic diversity in the oceans. Priorities for selecting invertebrates for sequencing will include, but are not restricted to, their phylogenetic placement; relevance to organismal, ecological, and conservation research; and their importance to fisheries and human health. We highlight benefits of sequencing both whole genomes (DNA) and transcriptomes and also suggest policies for genomic-level data access and sharing based on transparency and inclusiveness. The GIGA Web site (http://giga.nova.edu) has been launched to facilitate this collaborative venture.

N2  - Many students encounter difficulty in principles of microeconomics courses due to poor study skills and attitudes that hinder effective learning. These deficiencies delay development of critical thinking skills. Students commonly focus on last-minute, late-night cramming of material into short-term memory, only to promptly forget what they learned once the exam is over. As a result, exam grades in microeconomics tend to be low which contributes to low student morale and decreased future performance. In order to improve each student’s academic achievement, long-term learning must occur, which is necessary both for critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. This study describes how incorporating effective study tips and time management strategies as a part of reviewing exam performance can help students improve long-term learning, thus leading to improved critical thinking skills. By reviewing student performance on quizzes and exams to identify why mistakes were made and supplying the students with specific strategies and study skills tailored to correcting those errors, students can adopt strategic plans to improve their exam performance and to improve long-term retention of information.

N2  - A rapid non-destructive alternative to isolate DNA from an individual fish larva is presented, based on the suspension of epithelial cells through vortex forces, and the release of DNA in a heated alkaline solution. DNA from >6056 fish larvae isolated using this protocol has yielded a high PCR amplification success rate (>93%), suggesting its applicability to other taxonomic groups or sources when tissue amount is the limiting factor.

N2  - Human pharmaceuticals are commonly detected in the environment. Concern over these compounds in the environment center around the potential for pharmaceuticals to interfere with the endocrine system of aquatic organisms. The main focus of endocrine disruption research has centered on how estrogenic and androgenic compounds interact with the endocrine system to elicit reproductive effects. Other classes of compounds, such as progestins, have been overlooked. Recently, studies have investigated the potential for synthetic progestins to impair reproduction and growth in aquatic organisms. The present study utilizes the OECD 210 Early-life Stage (ELS) study to investigate the impacts levonorgestrel (LNG), a synthetic progestin, on fathead minnow (FHM) survival and growth. After 28 days post-hatch, survival of larval FHM was impacted at 462 ng/L, while growth was significantly reduced at 86.9 ng/L. Further analysis was conducted by measuring specific endocrine related mRNA transcript profiles in FHM larvae following the 28 day ELS exposure to LNG. Transcripts of 3β-HSD, 20β-HSD, CYP17, AR, ERα, and FSH were significantly down-regulated following 28d exposure to 16.3 ng/L LNG, while exposure to 86.9 ng/L significantly down-regulated 3β-HSD, 20β-HSD, CYP19A, and FSH. At 2,392 ng/L of LNG, a significant down-regulation occurred with CYP19A and ERβ transcripts, while mPRα and mPRβ profiles were significantly induced. No significant changes occurred in 11β-HSD, CYP11A, StAR, LHβ, and VTG mRNA expression following LNG exposure. An ex vivo steroidogenesis assay was conducted with sexually mature female FHM following a 7 day exposure 100 ng/L LNG with significant reductions observed in pregnenolone, 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20-DHP), testosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone. Together these data suggest LNG can negatively impact FHM larval survival and growth, with significant alterations in endocrine related responses.

N2  - The feeding kinematics, suction and hydraulic jetting capabilities of captive harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) were characterized during controlled feeding trials. Feeding trials were conducted using a feeding apparatus that allowed a choice between biting and suction, but also presented food that could be ingested only by suction. Subambient pressure exerted during suction feeding behaviors was directly measured using pressure transducers. The mean feeding cycle duration for suction-feeding events was significantly shorter (0.15±0.09 s; P<0.01) than biting feeding events (0.18±0.08 s). Subjects feeding in-water used both a suction and a biting feeding mode. Suction was the favored feeding mode (84% of all feeding events) compared to biting, but biting comprised 16% of feeding events. In addition, seals occasionally alternated suction with hydraulic jetting, or used hydraulic jetting independently, to remove fish from the apparatus. Suction and biting feeding modes were kinematically distinct regardless of feeding location (in-water vs. on-land). Suction was characterized by a significantly smaller gape (1.3±0.23 cm; P<0.001) and gape angle (12.9±2.02°), pursing of the rostral lips to form a circular aperture, and pursing of the lateral lips to occlude lateral gape. Biting was characterized by a large gape (3.63±0.21 cm) and gape angle (28.8±1.80°; P<0.001) and lip curling to expose teeth. The maximum subambient pressure recorded was 48.8 kPa. In addition, harbor seals were able to jet water at food items using suprambient pressure, also known as hydraulic jetting. The maximum hydraulic jetting force recorded was 53.9 kPa. Suction and hydraulic jetting where employed 90.5% and 9.5%, respectively, during underwater feeding events. Harbor seals displayed a wide repertoire of behaviorally flexible feeding strategies to ingest fish from the feeding apparatus. Such flexibility of feeding strategies and biomechanics likely forms the basis of their opportunistic, generalized feeding ecology and concomitant breadth of diet.

N2  - The abundance of the subarctic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, and temperate, shelf copepod, Centropages typicus, was estimated from samples collected bi-monthly over the Northeast U.S. continental shelf (NEUS) from 1977-2010. Latitudinal variation in long term trends and seasonal patterns for the two copepod species were examined for four sub-regions: the Gulf of Maine (GOM), Georges Bank (GB), Southern New England (SNE), and Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB). Results suggested that there was significant difference in long term variation between northern region (GOM and GB), and the MAB for both species. C. finmarchicus generally peaked in May - June throughout the entire study region and Cen. typicus had a more complex seasonal pattern. Time series analysis revealed that the peak time for Cen. typicus switched from November - December to January - March after 1985 in the MAB. The long term abundance of C. finmarchicus showed more fluctuation in the MAB than the GOM and GB, whereas the long term abundance of Cen. typicus was more variable in the GB than other sub-regions. Alongshore transport was significantly correlated with the abundance of C. finmarchicus, i.e., more water from north, higher abundance for C. finmarchicus. The abundance of Cen. typicus showed positive relationship with the Gulf Stream north wall index (GSNWI) in the GOM and GB, but the GSNWI only explained 12-15% of variation in Cen. typicus abundance. In general, the alongshore current was negatively correlated with the GSNWI, suggesting that Cen. typicus is more abundant when advection from the north is less. However, the relationship between Cen. typicus and alongshore transport was not significant. The present study highlights the importance of spatial scales in the study of marine populations: observed long term changes in the northern region were different from the south for both species.

N2  - Although the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system exports large amounts of nutrients to the Northern Gulf of Mexico annually, nutrient limitation of primary productivity still occurs offshore, acting as one of the major factors controlling local phytoplankton biomass and community structure. Bioassays were conducted for 48 hrs at two stations adjacent to the river plumes in April and August 2012. High Performance of Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) combined with ChemTax and a Fluorescence Induction and Relaxation (FIRe) system were combined to observe changes in the phytoplankton community structure and photosynthetic activity. Major fluorescence parameters (Fo, Fv/Fm) performed well to reveal the stimulating effect of the treatments with nitrogen (N-nitrate) and with nitrogen plus phosphate (+NPi). HPLC/ChemTax results showed that phytoplankton community structure shifted with nitrate addition: we observed an increase in the proportion of diatoms and prasinophytes and a decrease in cyanobacteria and prymnesiophytes. These findings are consistent with predictions from trait-based analysis which predict that phytoplankton groups with high maximum growth rates (μmax ) and high nutrient uptake rates (Vmax ) readily take advantage of the addition of limiting nutrients. Changes in phytoplankton community structure, if persistent, could trigger changes of particular organic matter fluxes and alter the micro-food web cycles and bottom oxygen consumption.

N2  - To study the effects of natural organic matter (NOM) on Pu sorption, Pu(IV) and (V) were amended at environmentally relevant concentrations (10(-14) M) to two soils of contrasting particulate NOM concentrations collected from the F-Area of the Savannah River Site. More Pu(IV) than (V) was bound to soil colloidal organic matter (COM). A de-ashed humic acid (i.e., metals being removed) scavenged more Pu(IV,V) into its colloidal fraction than the original HA incorporated into its colloidal fraction, and an inverse trend was thus observed for the particulate-fraction-bound Pu for these two types of HAs. However, the overall Pu binding capacity of HA (particulate + colloidal-Pu) decreased after de-ashing. The presence of NOM in the F-Area soil did not enhance Pu fixation to the organic-rich soil when compared to the organic-poor soil or the mineral phase from the same soil source, due to the formation of COM-bound Pu. Most importantly, Pu uptake by organic-rich soil decreased with increasing pH because more NOM in the colloidal size desorbed from the particulate fraction in the elevated pH systems, resulting in greater amounts of Pu associated with the COM fraction. This is in contrast to previous observations with low-NOM sediments or minerals, which showed increased Pu uptake with increasing pH levels. This demonstrates that despite Pu immobilization by NOM, COM can convert Pu into a more mobile form.

N2  - Assessments of metabolic robustness or susceptibility are inherently dependent on quantitative descriptions of network structure and associated function. In this paper a stoichiometric model of piscine steroidogenesis was constructed and constrained with productions of selected steroid hormones. Structural and flux metrics of this in silico model were quantified by calculating extreme pathways and optimal flux distributions (using linear programming). Extreme pathway analysis showed progestin and corticosteroid synthesis reactions to be highly participant in extreme pathways. Furthermore, reaction participation in extreme pathways also fitted a power law distribution (degree exponent γ=2.3), which suggested that progestin and corticosteroid reactions act as 'hubs' capable of generating other functionally relevant pathways required to maintain steady-state functionality of the network. Analysis of cofactor usage (O2 and NADPH) showed progestin synthesis reactions to exhibit high robustness, whereas estrogen productions showed highest energetic demands with low associated robustness to maintain such demands. Linear programming calculated optimal flux distributions showed high heterogeneity of flux values with a near-random power law distribution (degree exponent γ≥2.7). Subsequently, network robustness was tested by assessing maintenance of metabolite flux-sum subject to targeted deletions of rank-ordered (low to high metric) extreme pathway participant and optimal flux reactions. Network robustness was susceptible to deletions of extreme pathway participant reactions, whereas minimal impact of high flux reaction deletion was observed. This analysis shows that the steroid network is susceptible to perturbation of structurally relevant (extreme pathway) reactions rather than those carrying high flux.

N2  - <jats:p> Increasing interest in fostering resilient communities requires a more comprehensive approach to hazard mitigation planning that overcomes the limitations of traditional hazard assessments, notably the failure to explicitly incorporate an analysis of social vulnerability. We statistically analyzed a random sample of 1500 damage assessments of single-family homes collected following Hurricane Ike to assess the contributions of hazard exposure, structural vulnerability, and social vulnerability. The results indicate that hazard exposure, structural characteristics, and socioeconomic characteristics are significant predictors of structural damage. The implications suggest that comprehensive hazard assessments can provide additional insights for mitigation planning and community resiliency. </jats:p>

N2  - The release of radioactive iodine (i.e., iodine-129 and iodine-131) from nuclear reprocessing facilities is a potential threat to human health. The fate and transport of iodine are determined primarily by its redox status, but processes that affect iodine oxidation states in the environment are poorly characterized. Given the difficulty in removing electrons from iodide (I(-)), naturally occurring iodide oxidation processes require strong oxidants, such as Mn oxides or microbial enzymes. In this study, we examine iodide oxidation by a marine bacterium, Roseobacter sp. AzwK-3b, which promotes Mn(II) oxidation by catalyzing the production of extracellular superoxide (O2(-)). In the absence of Mn(2+), Roseobacter sp. AzwK-3b cultures oxidized ∼90% of the provided iodide (10 μM) within 6 days, whereas in the presence of Mn(II), iodide oxidation occurred only after Mn(IV) formation ceased. Iodide oxidation was not observed during incubations in spent medium or with whole cells under anaerobic conditions or following heat treatment (boiling). Furthermore, iodide oxidation was significantly inhibited in the presence of superoxide dismutase and diphenylene iodonium (a general inhibitor of NADH oxidoreductases). In contrast, the addition of exogenous NADH enhanced iodide oxidation. Taken together, the results indicate that iodide oxidation was mediated primarily by extracellular superoxide generated by Roseobacter sp. AzwK-3b and not by the Mn oxides formed by this organism. Considering that extracellular superoxide formation is a widespread phenomenon among marine and terrestrial bacteria, this could represent an important pathway for iodide oxidation in some environments.

N2  - Like many other annelids, bearded fireworms, Hermodice carunculata, are capable of regenerating posterior body segments and terminal structures lost to amputation. Although previous research has examined anterior regeneration in other fireworm species, posterior regenerative ability in fireworms remains poorly studied. As the morphology of the anal lobe (a small, fleshy terminal structure of unknown function) has been used to distinguish East and West Atlantic H. carunculata populations, there is a more imminent need to understand the morphology and organization of tissues in specimens undergoing posterior regeneration, and the timeframe in which significant developmental changes occur. To further investigate this phenomenon, we amputated the posterior segments of living H. carunculata specimens collected from the Gulf of Mexico and monitored posterior regeneration over a 6-month study period. Although many aspects of posterior regeneration in H. carunculata are consistent with the findings of other annelid regeneration studies, histological analysis revealed that once formed, anal lobe morphology remains relatively unchanged at all stages of posterior regeneration; East Atlantic morphotypes were not observed in the West Atlantic specimens studied here. Additionally, we found that the ventral nerve chord, which is partially responsible for the regeneration of lost body parts in polychaete annelids, terminates within the anal lobe, suggesting that this structure may play a role in the formation of new segments.

N2  - Podocoryna loyola, a new hydractiniid species, has been found on artificial substrates in Baía de Paranaguá, southern coast of Brazil, since April 2007. Its main morphological characteristics are: (1) polymorphic colonies with reticular stolons or encrusting hydrorhiza not covered by periderm and smooth chitinous spines; (2) newly-released medusae with eight tentacles and small interradial gonads; (3) mature medusae with eight tentacles and unbranched oral lips; gastric peduncle absent. Molecular data show that P. loyola is distinct from all other examined species of Podocoryna, and from P. hayamaensis Hirohito (1988), its sister species from Japan. As the polyps having been noted only quite recently, and in having been found only on man-made objects in port areas and estuaries, the species is most likely exotic to the region.

N2  - Living reef fishes are one of the most diverse vertebrate assemblages on Earth. Despite its prominence and ecological importance, the origins and assembly of the reef fish fauna is poorly described. A patchy fossil record suggests that the major colonization of reef habitats must have occurred in the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene, with the earliest known modern fossil coral reef fish assemblage dated to 50 Ma. Using a phylogenetic approach, we analysed the early evolutionary dynamics of modern reef fishes. We find that reef lineages successively colonized reef habitats throughout the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene. Two waves of invasion were accompanied by increasing morphological convergence: one in the Late Cretaceous from 90 to 72 Ma and the other immediately following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. The surge in reef invasions after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary continued for 10 Myr, after which the pace of transitions to reef habitats slowed. Combined, these patterns match a classic niche-filling scenario: early transitions to reefs were made rapidly by morphologically distinct lineages and were followed by a decrease in the rate of invasions and eventual saturation of morphospace. Major alterations in reef composition, distribution and abundance, along with shifts in climate and oceanic currents, occurred during the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene interval. A causal mechanism between these changes and concurrent episodes of reef invasion remains obscure, but what is clear is that the broad framework of the modern reef fish fauna was in place within 10 Myr of the end-Cretaceous extinction.

N2  - The Changjiang has transported large quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to the East China Sea (ECS), but information of these pollutants in zooplankton is limited. To understand PAHs pollution in zooplankton in the ECS, total concentrations of PAHs in zooplankton from surface waters were measured. Values of PAHs ranged from 2 to 3500 ng m(-3) in the ECS, with highest PAHs levels located at the salinity front between the Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) and the mid-shelf waters. In contrast, concentrations of zooplankton PAHs in the mid-shelf and outer-shelf waters were significantly lower (2-23 ng m(-3)) than those in the CDW. These results demonstrate that PAHs are conspicuously accumulated in zooplankton at the salinity front between the CDW and the mid-shelf waters. These higher levels of PAHs in zooplankton at the salinity front may be further biomagnified in marine organisms of higher trophic levels through their feeding activities.

N2  - A new genus and species of speleophriid copepod, Mexicophria cenoticola gen. et sp. nov., is described based on material collected from a cenote in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. It is characterised by relatively reduced fifth legs that are located adjacent to the ventral midline in both sexes, by the possession of a bulbous swelling on the first antennulary segment in both sexes, and by the reduced setation of the swimming legs. The presence of just one inner margin seta on the second endopodal segment of legs 2 to 4 is a unique feature for the family. A phylogenetic analysis places the new genus on a basal lineage of the family together with its sister taxon, Boxshallia Huys, 1988, from Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, and recovers the existing genera as monophyletic units. The zoogeography is discussed at local, regional, ocean basin  and global scales.

N2  - Urbanization and stream-channel modifications affect organic matter concentrations and quality in streams, by altering allochthonous organic matter input and in-stream transformation. This study uses multiple tracers (δ(13)C, δ(15)N, C/N ratio, and chlorophyll-a) to track sources of organic matter in two highly urbanized bayous in Houston (Texas, USA). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are located in headwaters of both bayous and contribute more than 75% to water flow. Low isotopic relatedness to natural end-members and enriched δ(15)N values suggest the influence of WWTPs on the composition of all organic matter fractions. The two bayous differ in degree of channel improvement resulting in different responses to hydrological conditions. During high flow conditions, the influence of terrestrial organic matter and sediment resuspension was much more pronounced in the Buffalo Bayou than in the concrete-lined White Oak Bayou. Particulate organic matter (POM) in White Oak Bayou had similar values of enriched δ(15)N in all subsegments, whereas in Buffalo Bayou, the degree of δ(15)N enrichment was less in the subsegments of the lower watershed. The difference in riparian zone contributions and interactions with sediments/soils was likely responsible for the compositional differences between the two bayous. Phytoplankton inputs were significantly higher in the bayous, especially in slow-flowing sections, relative to the reference sites, and elevated phytoplankton inputs accounted for the observed stable C isotope differences between FPOM and high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMW DOM). Relative to POM, HMW DOM in the bayous was similar to WWTP effluents and showed minor longitudinal variability in both streams suggesting that WWTPs contribute much of the DOM in the systems. Urbanization has a major influence on organic matter sources and quality in these urban water bodies and these changes seem further enhanced by stream channel modifications.

N2  - The common shovelnose ray (Glaucostegus typus) is a poorly studied species of the Rhinobatidae family that occurs throughout the Indo-West Pacific. Although common in aquariums throughout the United States, there are currently no records of captive birth events. In 2013, a female common shovelnose ray housed at the Downtown Aquarium in Houston, Texas, USA gave birth to eleven pups. Although all pups were stillborn, this event demonstrates that it is possible to breed common shovelnose rays in a controlled environment. The single female and two male common shovelnose rays at the aquarium are of sexually mature size (between 206 and 240 cm total length, TL), demonstrate mating behaviors, and provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the reproductive biology of this species. Captive environmental conditions of the birth enclosure may be useful in replicating the birthing event in order to develop a breeding program that could potentially relieve collection pressures on wild populations of guitarfish given their vulnerable status.

N2  - Structural organization of macromolecules is highly dependent on the conformational propensity of the monomer units. Our goal is to systematically quantify differences in the conformational propensities of aromatic oligourea foldamer units. Specifically, we investigate the conformational propensities of N,N'-diphenylurea and N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-diphenylurea in different media using a combination of theoretical methods, and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Our results show variation in the conformational behavior upon adding methyl substituents on N,N'-diphenylurea, and varying the environments surrounding the compounds. Our energetic analyses and conformational distributions in the gas phase show predominance of the cis-trans and trans-trans conformations for N,N'-diphenylurea, while cis-cis conformation is favored for N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-diphenylurea. In solution, our results support the trans-trans conformer as the predominant conformer for N,N'-diphenylurea, whereas the cis-cis and cis-trans forms are favored in N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-diphenylurea. N,N'-Dimethyl-N,N'-diphenylurea also exhibits a more dynamic conformational behavior in solution, with constant fluctuations between cis-cis and cis-trans conformations. Our detailed quantitative analyses are an important aspect in fine-tuning desired conformations and dynamic properties of this class of oligomers by providing a molecular basis for the behavior at the monomeric level.

N2  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Weddell seals are polar predators that must partition their time between many behaviours, including hunting prey at depth and breathing at the surface. Although they have been well studied, little is known about how foraging behaviour changes when access to breathing holes is restricted, such as in the isolated-hole paradigm. The current study took advantage of previously gathered data for seals diving at an isolated hole to compare with foraging behaviour of free-ranging seals that had access to multiple holes. We examined dive structure, hunting tactics, and allocation of time, locomotor activity and energy based on three-dimensional dive profiles and video imagery of prey encounters for two free-ranging and six isolated-hole seals. Midsummer foraging dives of free-ranging seals were remarkably similar to those of seals diving at an isolated hole, but there were differences in two behavioural states and the frequency of several behavioural transitions. Results indicate that seals employ an energetically more conservative foraging strategy when access to breathing holes is limited and prey are less abundant. These results highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between breathing hole access, prey abundance and other factors that may result in different Weddell seal foraging strategies under changing future conditions.</jats:p>

N2  - Understanding the interconnectivity of oceanic carbon and nitrogen cycles, specifically carbon and nitrogen fixation, is essential in elucidating the fate and distribution of carbon in the ocean. Traditional techniques measure either organism abundance or biochemical rates. As such, measurements are performed on separate samples and on different time scales. Here, we developed a method to simultaneously quantify organisms while estimating rates of fixation across time and space for both carbon and nitrogen. Tyramide signal amplification fluorescence in situ hybridization (TSA-FISH) of mRNA for functionally specific oligonucleotide probes for rbcL (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; carbon fixation) and nifH (nitrogenase; nitrogen fixation) was combined with flow cytometry to measure abundance and estimate activity. Cultured samples representing a diversity of phytoplankton (cyanobacteria, coccolithophores, chlorophytes, diatoms, and dinoflagellates), as well as environmental samples from the open ocean (Gulf of Mexico, USA, and southeastern Indian Ocean, Australia) and an estuary (Galveston Bay, Texas, USA), were successfully hybridized. Strong correlations between positively tagged community abundance and (14)C/(15)N measurements are presented. We propose that these methods can be used to estimate carbon and nitrogen fixation in environmental communities. The utilization of mRNA TSA-FISH to detect multiple active microbial functions within the same sample will offer increased understanding of important biogeochemical cycles in the ocean.

N2  - Terahertz radiation has uses in applications ranging from security to medicine. However, sensitive room-temperature detection of terahertz radiation is notoriously difficult. The hot-electron photothermoelectric effect in graphene is a promising detection mechanism; photoexcited carriers rapidly thermalize due to strong electron-electron interactions, but lose energy to the lattice more slowly. The electron temperature gradient drives electron diffusion, and asymmetry due to local gating or dissimilar contact metals produces a net current via the thermoelectric effect. Here, we demonstrate a graphene thermoelectric terahertz photodetector with sensitivity exceeding 10 V W(-1) (700 V W(-1)) at room temperature and noise-equivalent power less than 1,100 pW Hz(-1/2) (20 pW Hz(-1/2)), referenced to the incident (absorbed) power. This implies a performance that is competitive with the best room-temperature terahertz detectors for an optimally coupled device, and time-resolved measurements indicate that our graphene detector is eight to nine orders of magnitude faster than those. A simple model of the response, including contact asymmetries (resistance, work function and Fermi-energy pinning) reproduces the qualitative features of the data, and indicates that orders-of-magnitude sensitivity improvements are possible.

N2  - The new Aquatic Laser Fluorescence Analyzer (ALFA) provides spectral and temporal measurements of laser-stimulated emission (LSE) for assessment of phytoplankton pigments, community structure, photochemical efficiency (PY), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The instrument was deployed in the Northern Gulf of Mexico to evaluate the ALFA analytical capabilities across the estuarine-marine gradient. The robust relationships between the pigment fluorescence and independent pigment measurements were used to validate the ALFA analytical algorithms and calibrate the instrument. The maximal PY magnitudes, PYm = PY(1-1.35·10⁻⁴PAR⁻¹, were estimated using the underway measurements of PY and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The chlorophyll (Chl) spatial patterns were calculated using the ratio of Chl fluorescence to PY to eliminate the effect of non-photochemical quenching on the underway Chl assessments. These measurements have provided rich information about spatial distributions of Chl, PYm, CDOM, and phytoplankton community structure, and demonstrated the utility of the ALFA instrument for oceanographic studies and bio-environmental surveys. The data suggest that the fluorescence measurements with 514 nm excitation can provide informative data for characterization of the CDOM-rich fresh, estuarine, and coastal aquatic environments.

N2  - A 100-year history of human and natural disturbances in southwestern Taiwan was reconstructed using a suite of molecular markers in four dated sediment cores from the upper slope region off the Gaoping River mouth. Trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) tracked Taiwan's industrialization/urbanization starting in the 1970s, and the enactment of environmental regulatory policies thereafter. The predominant pyrogenic sources include vehicular, smelter, and coal combustion but spatial differences are observed among sub-regions of the shelf. Profiles of lignin oxidation products (LOPs) point to a significant increase in terrestrial organic matter inputs driven by land development after the 1970s. Low lignin diagenetic signature ratios [(Ad/Al)v] in all sediments suggest quick transport of fresh plant material from land to sea via mountainous rivers. Shifts in PAHs, LOPs, and radionuclides in recent sediments reveal the deposition of turbidites resulting from typhoon-induced floods. Multiproxy analysis illustrates the interplay between anthropogenic activities and natural processes.

N2  - Over the last several decades, the distribution of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans in the Gulf of Mexico has expanded, in part because it can survive the occasional freeze events and high soil salinities characteristic of the area. Vessel architecture may influence mangrove chilling and salinity tolerance. We surveyed populations of A. germinans throughout the Gulf to determine if vessel architecture was linked to field environmental conditions. We measured vessel density, hydraulically weighted vessel diameter, potential conductance capacity, and maximum tensile fracture stress. At each sampling site we recorded mangrove canopy height and soil salinity, and determined average minimum winter temperature from archived weather records. At a subset of sites, we measured carbon fixation rates using a LI-COR 6400XT Portable Photosynthesis System. Populations of A. germinans from cooler areas (Texas and Louisiana) had narrower vessels, likely reducing the risk of freeze-induced embolisms but also decreasing water conductance capacity. Vessels were also narrower in regions with high soil salinity, including Texas, USA and tidal flats in Veracruz, Mexico. Vessel density did not consistently vary with temperature or soil salinity. In abiotically stressful areas, A. germinans had a safe hydraulic architecture with narrower vessels that may increase local survival. This safe architecture appears to come at a substantial physiological cost in terms of reduction in conductance capacity and carbon fixation potential, likely contributing to lower canopy heights. The current distribution of A. germinans in the Gulf is influenced by the complex interplay between temperature, salinity, and vessel architecture. Given the plasticity of A. germinans vessel characters, it is likely that this mangrove species will be able to adapt to a wide range of potential future environmental conditions, and continue its expansion in the Gulf of Mexico in response to near-term climate change.

N2  - Dorsal and pectoral fin spines from two species of sea catfishes (Bagre marinus and Ariopsis felis) landed at 54 sites in Galveston Bay, Texas, and its sub-bays from June to October 2005 were screened with traditional cultivation-based assays and quantitative PCR assays for Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. V. vulnificus was present on 51.2% of fish (n = 247), with an average of 403 ± 337 SD cells g(-1). V. parahaemolyticus was present on 94.2% (n = 247); 12.8% tested positive for the virulence-conferring tdh gene, having an average 2,039 ± 2,171 SD cells g(-1). The increasing trend in seafood consumption of "trash fishes" from lower trophic levels, such as sea catfishes, warrants evaluation of their life histories for association with pathogens of concern for human consumption.

N2  - (129)I derived from a former radionuclide disposal basin located on the Savannah River Site (SRS) has concentrated in a wetland 600 m downstream. To evaluate temporal environmental influences on iodine speciation and mobility in this subtropical wetland environment, groundwater was collected over a three-year period (2010-2012) from a single location. Total (127)I and (129)I showed significant temporal variations, ranging from 68-196 nM for (127)I and <5-133 pCi/L for (129)I. These iodine isotopes were significantly correlated with groundwater acidity and nitrate, two parameters elevated within the contaminant plume. Additionally, (129)I levels were significantly correlated with those of (127)I, suggesting that biogeochemical controls on (127)I and (129)I are similar within the SRS aquifer/wetland system. Iodine speciation demonstrates temporal variations as well, reflecting effects from surface recharges followed by acidification of groundwater and subsequent formation of anaerobic conditions. Our results reveal a complex system where few single ancillary parameters changed in a systematic manner with iodine speciation. Instead, changes in groundwater chemistry and microbial activity, driven by surface hydrological events, interact to control iodine speciation and mobility. Future radiological risk models should consider the flux of (129)I in response to temporal changes in wetland hydrologic and chemical conditions.

N2  - Global movement of nonindigenous species, within ballast water tanks across natural barriers, threatens coastal and estuarine ecosystem biodiversity. In 2012, the Port of Houston ranked 10th largest in the world and 2nd in the US (waterborne tonnage). Ballast water was collected from 13 vessels to genetically examine the eukaryotic microorganism diversity being discharged into the Port of Houston, Texas (USA). Vessels took ballast water onboard in North Atlantic Ocean between the Port of Malabo, Africa and Port of New Orleans, Louisiana, (USA). Twenty genera of Protists, Fungi and Animalia were identified from at least 10 phyla. Dinoflagellates were the most diverse and dominant identified (Alexandrium, Exuviaella, Gyrodinium, Heterocapsa, Karlodinium, Pfiesteria and Scrippsiella). We are reporting the first detection of Picobiliphytes, Apusozoa (Amastigomonas) and Sarcinomyces within ballast water. This study supports that global commerce by shipping contributes to long-distance transportation of eukaryotic microorganisms, increasing propagule pressure and invasion supply on ecosystems.

N2  - During the last few decades, considerable research efforts have been extended to identify more effective remediation treatment technologies to lower the (129)I concentrations to below federal drinking water standards at the Hanford Site (Richland, USA). Few studies have taken iodate into consideration, though recently iodate, instead of iodide, was identified as the major species in the groundwater of 200-West Area within the Hanford Site. The objective of this study was thus to quantify and understand aqueous radioiodine species transformations and uptake by three sediments collected from the semi-arid, carbonate-rich environment of the Hanford subsurface. All three sediments reduced iodate (IO3(-)) to iodide (I(-)), but the loamy-sand sediment reduced more IO3(-) (100% reduced within 7 days) than the two sand-textured sediments (∼20% reduced after 28 days). No dissolved organo-iodine species were observed in any of these studies. Iodate uptake Kd values ([Isolid]/[Iaq]; 0.8-7.6 L/kg) were consistently and appreciably greater than iodide Kd values (0-5.6 L/kg). Furthermore, desorption Kd values (11.9-29.8 L/kg) for both iodate and iodide were consistently and appreciably greater than uptake Kd values (0-7.6 L/kg). Major fractions of iodine associated with the sediments were unexpectedly strongly bound, such that only 0.4-6.6 % of the total sedimentary iodine could be exchanged from the surface with KCl solution, and 0-1.2% was associated with Fe or Mn oxides (weak NH2HCl/HNO3 extractable fraction). Iodine incorporated into calcite accounted for 2.9-39.4% of the total sedimentary iodine, whereas organic carbon (OC) is likely responsible for the residual iodine (57.1-90.6%) in sediments. The OC, even at low concentrations, appeared to be controlling iodine binding to the sediments, as it was found that the greater the OC concentrations in the sediments, the greater the values of uptake Kd, desorption Kd, and the greater residual iodine concentrations (non-exchangeable, non-calcite-incorporated and non-Mn, Fe-oxide associated). This finding is of particular interest because it suggests that even very low OC concentrations, <0.2%, may have an impact on iodine geochemistry. The findings that these sediments can readily reduce IO3(-), and that IO3(-) sorbs to a greater extent than I(-), sheds light into earlier unexplained Hanford field data that demonstrated increases in groundwater (127)I(-)/(127)IO3(-) ratios and a decrease groundwater (129)IO3(-) concentrations along a transect away from the point sources, where iodine was primarily introduced as IO3(-). While a majority of the radioiodine does not bind to these alkaline sediments, there is likely a second smaller iodine fraction in the Hanford subsurface that is strongly bound, presumably to the sediment OC (and carbonate) phases. This second fraction may have an impact on establishing remediation goals and performance assessment calculations.

N2  - 129I is commonly either the top or among the top risk drivers, along with 99Tc, at radiological waste disposal sites and contaminated groundwater sites where nuclear material fabrication or reprocessing has occurred. The risk stems largely from 129I having a high toxicity, a high bioaccumulation factor (90% of all the body's iodine concentrates in the thyroid), a high inventory at source terms (due to its high fission yield), an extremely long half-life (16M years), and rapid mobility in the subsurface environment. Another important reason that 129I is a key risk driver is that there is uncertainty regarding its biogeochemical fate and transport in the environment. We typically can define 129I mass balance and flux at sites, but cannot predict accurately its response to changes in the environment. As a consequence of some of these characteristics, 129I has a very low drinking water standard, which is set at 1 pCi/L, the lowest of all radionuclides in the Federal Register. Recently, significant advancements have been made in detecting iodine species at ambient groundwater concentrations, defining the nature of the organic matter and iodine bond, and quantifying the role of naturally occurring sediment microbes to promote iodine oxidation and reduction. These recent studies have led to a more mechanistic understanding of radioiodine biogeochemistry. The objective of this review is to describe these advances and to provide a state of the science of radioiodine biogeochemistry relevant to its fate and transport in the terrestrial environment and provide information useful for making decisions regarding the stewardship and remediation of 129I contaminated sites. As part of this review, knowledge gaps were identified that would significantly advance the goals of basic and applied research programs for accelerating 129I environmental remediation and reducing uncertainty associated with disposal of 129I waste. Together the information gained from addressing these knowledge gaps will not alter the observation that 129I is primarily mobile, but it will likely permit demonstration that the entire 129I pool in the source term is not moving at the same rate and some may be tightly bound to the sediment, thereby smearing the modeled 129I peak and reducing maximum calculated risk.

N2  - Following intense overfishing in the 1970s, the western stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) experienced a long period of depressed abundance, which has been attributed to failure of the population to periodically produce large numbers of juveniles, the western stock mixing with the more highly exploited eastern stock (fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea), and regime shift in the population's ecosystem resulting in lower replacement rates. To evaluate the presence of relatively strong years of juvenile production, we analyzed age structure from a recent sample of otoliths (ear stones) collected from the western stock (2011-2013, North Carolina, U.S.A., winter fishery). Mixing levels for the recent sample were analyzed using otolith stable isotopes to test whether age structure might be biased through immigration of eastern stock bluefin tuna. Age structure from historical samples collected from United States and Canadian fisheries (1975-1981) was compared with more recent samples (1996-2007) to examine whether demographic changes had occurred to the western stock that might have disrupted juvenile production. Relatively high juvenile production occurred in 2003, 2005, and 2006. Otolith stable isotope analysis showed that these recruitments were mostly of western stock origin. However, these high recruitments were >2-fold less than historical recruitment. We found substantial age truncation in the sampled fisheries. Half the historical sample was >20 years old (mean age = 20.1 [SD 3.7]; skewness = -0.3), whereas <5% of the recent sample was >20 years old (mean age = 13.4 [SD 3.8]; skewness = 1.3). Loss of age structure is consistent with changes in fishing selectivity and trends in the stock assessment used for management. We propose that fishing, as a forcing variable, brought about a threshold shift in the western stock toward lower biomass and production, a shift that emulates the regime shift hypothesis. An abbreviated reproductive life span compromised resilience by reducing the period over which adults spawn and thereby curtailing the stock's ability to sample year-to-year variability in conditions that favor offspring survival (i.e., storage effect). Because recruitment dynamics by the western stock exhibit threshold dynamics, returning it to a higher production state will entail greater reductions in exploitation rates.

N2  - Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are the most recent group of mammals to return to the sea, and may exemplify divergent somatosensory tactile systems among mammals. Therefore, we quantified the mystacial vibrissal array of sea otters and histologically processed follicle-sinus complexes (F - SCs) to test the hypotheses that the number of myelinated axons per F - SC is greater than that found for terrestrial mammalian vibrissae and that their organization and microstructure converge with those of pinniped vibrissae. A mean of 120.5 vibrissae were arranged rostrally on a broad, blunt muzzle in 7-8 rows and 9-13 columns. The F-SCs of sea otters are tripartite in their organization and similar in microstructure to pinnipeds rather than terrestrial species. Each F-SC was innervated by a mean 1339 ± 408.3 axons. Innervation to the entire mystacial vibrissal array was estimated at 161,313 axons. Our data support the hypothesis that the disproportionate expansion of the coronal gyrus in somatosensory cortex of sea otters is related to the high innervation investment of the mystacial vibrissal array, and that quantifying innervation investment is a good proxy for tactile sensitivity. We predict that the tactile performance of sea otter mystacial vibrissae is comparable to that of harbor seals, sea lions and walruses.

N2  - Little is known about the tactics northern elephant seals (NES) use to capture prey due to the difficulties in observing these animals underwater. NES forage on vertically migrating prey at depths >500 m during day and at night where light levels are negligible. Although NES have increased visual sensitivity in deep water, vision is likely a limited sensory modality. Still images of NES foraging show that the mystacial vibrissae are protracted before prey capture. As a representative phocid, harbor seals can follow hydrodynamic trails using their vibrissae, and are highly sensitive to water velocity changes. In lieu of performance data, vibrissal innervation can be used as a proxy for sensitivity. Although comparative data are few, seals average 1,000 to 1,600 axons per vibrissa (five to eight times more than terrestrial mammals). To test the hypothesis that NES have increased innervation as other pinnipeds, vibrissae from the ventral-caudal mystacial field from nine individuals were sectioned and stained for microstructure (trichrome) and innervation (Bodian silver stain). Follicles were tripartite and consisted of lower and upper cavernous sinuses separated by a ring sinus containing an asymmetrical ringwulst. The deep vibrissal nerve penetrated the follicular capsule at the base, branched into several bundles, and coursed through the lower cavernous sinus to the ring sinus. Axons in the ring sinus terminated in the ringwulst and along the inner conical body. NES averaged 1,584 axons per vibrissa. The results add to the growing body of evidence that phocids, and perhaps all pinnipeds, possess highly sensitive mystacial vibrissae that detect prey.

N2  - <jats:p>Interactive, online maps of sea level rise have great potential for communicating climate change, as evidenced by both their popularity and likely ability to combat discounting of climate change hazards. However, little is known about how different audiences will interpret the significant uncertainties—including those related to the amount, timing, and spatial coverage of sea level rise flooding—communicated on many of these maps. A review of the risk perception literature presents three situations where different aspects of uncertainty have been suggested to dictate (or at least strongly encourage) adaptive or mitigative action in the context of sea level rise or similarly uncertain hazards, then problematizes these accounts by showing how context and personal differences mediate (and in some cases reverse) these expected relationships. A final section offers preliminary reflections on the implications for the cartographic communication of climate change and sea level rise uncertainty.</jats:p>

N2  - A primary obstacle in understanding the fate and transport of the toxic radionuclide (129)I (a thyroid seeker) is an accurate method to distinguish it from the stable isotope, (127)I, and to quantify the various species at environmentally relevant concentrations (~10(-8) M). A pH-dependent solvent extraction and combustion method was paired with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to measure ambient levels of (129)I/(127)I isotope ratios and iodine speciation (iodide (I(-)), iodate (IO3(-)), and organo-I (OI)) in aquatic systems. The method exhibited an overall uncertainty of 10% or less for I(-) and IO3(-), and less than 30% for OI species concentrations and enabled (129)I measurements as low as 0.001 Bq/L (1 Bq/L=10(-13) M). The method was used to analyze groundwater from the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, USA, along a pH, redox potential (Eh), and organic carbon gradient (8-60 μM DOC). The data confirmed that the (129)I/(127)I ratios and species distribution were strongly pH dependent and varied in a systematic manner from the strongly acidic source. While (129)I speciation in plume samples containing total I concentrations >1.7 Bq/L was similar whether measured by AMS or GC-MS ([I(-)]≫[IO3(-)]=[OI]), AMS enabled (129)I speciation measurements at much lower concentrations than what was possible with GC-MS. AMS analyses demonstrated that groundwater samples minimally impacted by the plume were still orders of magnitude higher than ambient (129)I concentrations typically found elsewhere in the USA groundwaters and rivers. This is likely due to past atmospheric releases of volatile (129)I species by SRS nuclear reprocessing facilities near the study site. Furthermore, the results confirmed the existence of (129)I not only as I(-), but also as OI and IO3(-) species.

N2  - An accurate determination of myoglobin (Mb) oxygen affinity (P50) can be difficult due to hemoglobin (Hb) contamination and autoxidation of Mb to metMb which is incapable of binding oxygen. To reduce Mb autoxidation, P50 is often measured at refrigerated temperatures. However, the temperature dependent shift in Mb oxygen affinity results in a greater oxygen affinity (lower P50) at colder temperatures than occurs at physiological temperature (ca. 37-39°C) for birds and mammals. Utilizing the temperature dependent pH shift of Tris buffer, we developed novel methods to extract Mb from vertebrate muscle samples and remove Hb contamination while minimizing globin autoxidation. Cow (Bos taurus) muscle tissue (n=5) was homogenized in buffer to form a Mb solution, and Hb contamination was removed using anion exchange chromatography. A TCS Hemox Blood Analyzer was then used to quickly generate an oxygen dissociation curve for the extracted Mb. The oxygen affinity of extracted bovine Mb was compared to commercially available horse heart Mb. The oxygen affinity of extracted cow Mb (P50=3.72±0.16 mmHg) was not statistically different from commercially prepared horse heart Mb (P50=3.71±0.10 mmHg). With high yield Mb extraction and fast generation of an oxygen dissociation curve, it was possible to consistently determine Mb P50 under physiologically relevant conditions for endothermic vertebrates.

N2  - Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) song consists of down-swept pulses arranged into stereotypic sequences that can be characterized according to the interval between successive pulses. As in blue (B. musculus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), these song sequences may be geographically distinct and may correlate with population boundaries in some regions. We measured inter-pulse intervals of fin whale songs within year-round acoustic datasets collected between 2000 and 2006 in three regions of the eastern North Pacific: Southern California, the Bering Sea, and Hawaii. A distinctive song type that was recorded in all three regions is characterized by singlet and doublet inter-pulse intervals that increase seasonally, then annually reset to the same shorter intervals at the beginning of each season. This song type was recorded in the Bering Sea and off Southern California from September through May and off Hawaii from December through April, with the song interval generally synchronized across all monitoring locations. The broad geographic and seasonal occurrence of this particular fin whale song type may represent a single population broadly distributed throughout the eastern Pacific with no clear seasonal migratory pattern. Previous studies attempting to infer population structure of fin whales in the North Pacific using synchronous individual song samples have been unsuccessful, likely because they did not account for the seasonal lengthening in song intervals observed here.

N2  - One of the most striking biodiversity patterns is the uneven distribution of marine species richness, with species diversity in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) exceeding all other areas. However, the IAA formed fairly recently, and marine biodiversity hotspots have shifted across nearly half the globe since the Paleogene. Understanding how lineages have responded to shifting biodiversity hotspots represents a necessary historic perspective on the formation and maintenance of global marine biodiversity. Such evolutionary inferences are often challenged by a lack of fossil evidence that provide insights into historic patterns of abundance and diversity. The greatest diversity of squirrelfishes and soldierfishes (Holocentridae) is in the IAA, yet these fishes also represent some of the most numerous fossil taxa in deposits of the former West Tethyan biodiversity hotspot. We reconstruct the pattern of holocentrid range evolution using time-calibrated phylogenies that include most living species and several fossil lineages, demonstrating the importance of including fossil species as terminal taxa in ancestral area reconstructions. Holocentrids exhibit increased range fragmentation following the West Tethyan hotspot collapse. However, rather than originating within the emerging IAA hotspot, the IAA has acted as a reservoir for holocentrid diversity that originated in adjacent regions over deep evolutionary time scales.

N2  - The automotive industry has higher-skilled positions available that need engineers and engineering technologists qualified and capable to work in a high-paced, advanced manufacturing sector. Various educational programs across the country offer programs related to the motorsports area at the Associate of Science level. There are also various articu-lation agreements that enable students to continue their education to the baccalaureate level. These programs try to fill in the gap related to the skills shortage in systems and new design methods and processes. The main strength of such educational pathways is that students, who are trained to work as technicians with an associate's degree in automotive and motorsports areas and then continue onto complete their four-year undergraduate degree, have specific skills highly sought by the automotive industry. In this paper, the authors present an example of such an educational pathway, with an emphasis on motorsports.

N2  - The purpose of this research was to determine if Escherichia coli and enterococci in streambed and bank sediments from two urban bayous, Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou, in Houston, TX, USA are a significant source of the chronically high levels of these bacteria in the overlying water. The watersheds of the bayous lie within highly urbanized areas of Greater Houston and there is primary recreational contact with the public. Extensive sampling of the watersheds was conducted from 2008 to 2010. Both fecal indicator bacteria were found at ≥ 10(4)MPNgdry wt.(-1) concentrations in the upper 1cm of sediment cores with declines by orders of magnitude at 15 and 30 cm sediment horizons and in some cases 60 cm, but, nonetheless, indicating that they can remain viable even at depth. No interannual variation was observed. And, there was no correlation with percent organic matter, however there was moderate correlation (R(2)=0.12; p=0.001) of E. coli with sediment moisture. In sediments, most E. coli and enterococci in Buffalo Bayou (76%) and White Oak Bayou (87.5%) were associated with fine sand grains (60 to 250 μm). In the water column, E. coli was associated, in roughly equal percentages, with particle sizes <10, 10-25, 25-63, and ≥ 63 μm (21.9, 25.6, 30.4, and 32.9%, respectively). Enterococci were mostly attached to particle sizes in the ranges of 10-25μm (36.0%) and 25-63 μm (31.1%) as well as ≥ 63 μm (37.7%) (p=0.0001). Fingerprinting of E. coli isolates from both bayous with Rep-PCR and the BOX A1R primer was used to demonstrate translocation of sediments from the upper to lower watersheds.

N2  - © 2016 by Taylor  &  Francis Group, LLC. Bluefin tunas are large pelagic fishes that primarily prey on fishes and squids (Collette and Nauen 1983). The feeding ecology of bluefin tunas has been studied in depth primarily due to their high value in commercial and recreational fisheries (Collette and Nauen 1983). Because stock biomass and growth rates of bluefin tunas are potentially influenced by prey abundance, having a good understanding of species interactions in oceanic ecosystems is important. Furthermore, fishing grounds of bluefin tuna may be formed in prey abundant areas, thus fishermen have a vested interest in preference of bluefin tuna prey. In contrast, abundance of commercially important fishes and squids could also be influenced by abundance of predatory tunas. In the aquaculture field, information of prey species in their natural condition is useful to develop equivalent food for captive individuals. Consequently, the feeding ecology of bluefin tunas is important throughout all ocean basins.

N2  - Feeding performance studies can address questions relevant to feeding ecology and evolution. Our current understanding of feeding mechanisms for aquatic mammals is poor. Therefore, we characterized the feeding kinematics and performance of five Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) and six northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus). We tested the hypotheses that both species use suction as their primary feeding mode, and that rapid jaw opening was related to suction generation. Steller sea lions used suction as their primary feeding mode, but also used a biting feeding mode. In contrast, northern fur seals only used a biting feeding mode. Kinematic profiles of Steller sea lions were all indicative of suction feeding (i.e. a small gape, small gape angle, large depression of the hyolingual apparatus and lip pursing). However, jaw opening as measured by gape angle opening velocity (GAOV) was relatively slow in Steller sea lions. In contrast to Steller sea lions, the GAOV of northern fur seals was extremely fast, but their kinematic profiles indicated a biting feeding mode (i.e. northern fur seals exhibited a greater gape, a greater gape angle and minimal depression of the hyolingual apparatus compared with Steller sea lions). Steller sea lions produced both subambient and suprambient pressures at 45 kPa. In contrast, northern fur seals produced no detectable pressure measurements. Steller sea lions have a broader feeding repertoire than northern fur seals, which likely enables them to feed on a greater variety of prey, in more diverse habitats. Based on the basal phylogenetic position of northern fur seals, craniodental morphological data of the Callorhinus lineage, and the performance data provided in this study, we suggest that northern fur seals may be exhibiting their ancestral feeding mode.

N2  - Satellite imagery provides an effective platform to detect land-use and land-cover changes over a period of time. The changing land-use patterns over the years are an indicator to prioritize vulnerable areas to conversion processes within the Pipestem Creek Watershed of North Dakota, USA. The study demonstrates the applicability of remote sensing science in change detection. Landsat Thematic Mapper images acquired from the years 1976, 1991, 2000, 2005 and 2011 were used to quantify temporal changes from 1976 to 2011 by image classification techniques. Data analysis and classification were done using the remote sensing software ENVI® 4.5. Post classification confusion matrices were generated to  obtain accuracy assessment. The results quantify the land-cover change patterns in the watershed and demonstrate the potential of Landsat data in providing an accurate and cost effective way to analyze land-cover changes over time. This data can be utilized as essential inputs in land management and policy making.

N2  - Myoglobin (Mb) is an oxygen binding protein found in vertebrate skeletal muscle, where it facilitates intracellular transport and storage of oxygen. This protein has evolved to suit unique physiological needs in the muscle of diving vertebrates that express Mb at much greater concentrations than their terrestrial counterparts. In this study, we characterized Mb oxygen affinity (P50) from 25 species of aquatic and terrestrial birds and mammals. Among diving species, we tested for correlations between Mb P50 and routine dive duration. Across all species examined, Mb P50 ranged from 2.40 to 4.85 mmHg. The mean P50 of Mb from terrestrial ungulates was 3.72±0.15 mmHg (range 3.70-3.74 mmHg). The P50 of cetaceans was similar to terrestrial ungulates ranging from 3.54 to 3.82 mmHg, with the exception of the melon-headed whale, which had a significantly higher P50 of 4.85 mmHg. Among pinnipeds, the P50 ranged from 3.23 to 3.81 mmHg and showed a trend for higher oxygen affinity in species with longer dive durations. Among diving birds, the P50 ranged from 2.40 to 3.36 mmHg and also showed a trend of higher affinities in species with longer dive durations. In pinnipeds and birds, low Mb P50 was associated with species whose muscles are metabolically active under hypoxic conditions associated with aerobic dives. Given the broad range of potential globin oxygen affinities, Mb P50 from diverse vertebrate species appears constrained within a relatively narrow range. High Mb oxygen affinity within this range may be adaptive for some vertebrates that make prolonged dives.

               <jats:p>We used carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (δ13C and δ18O) in otoliths as a tool for identifying the nursery origin of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) caught in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay). Juvenile and adult bluefin tuna were collected over three consecutive years (2009—2011) using the regional bait boat fleet. Otolith δ13C and δ18O values of bluefin tuna were measured by mass spectrometry, and values were compared with a reference sample of yearling bluefin tuna from eastern (Mediterranean Sea) and western (Gulf of Mexico) nurseries to determine nursery origin. Maximum likelihood estimates based on otolith δ13C and δ18O values indicated that the overall contribution of western migrants to the Bay of Biscay fishery was &amp;lt;1% and varied over the years assessed. A small number of potential western migrants (2.7%) was detected in 2009, and most of these fish appear members of the abundant 2002 and 2003 year classes. In contrast, the Bay of Biscay fishery was composed exclusively (100%) of eastern origin bluefin tuna in 2010 and 2011, suggesting that this fishery is supported almost exclusively by the eastern spawning area but transatlantic western population may contribute to this fishery in a few years.</jats:p>

N2  - Most of the carbon fixed in primary production is rapidly cycled and remineralized, leaving behind various forms of organic carbon that contribute to a vast reservoir of nonliving organic matter in seawater. Most of this carbon resides in dissolved molecules of varying bioavailability and reactivity, and aspects of the cycling of this carbon remain an enigma. The size-reactivity continuum model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the mechanisms governing the formation and mineralization of this carbon. In the seawater bioassay experiments that served as the original basis for this model, investigators observed that larger size classes of organic matter were more bioavailable and more rapidly remineralized by microbes than were smaller size classes. Studies of the chemical composition and radiocarbon content of marine organic matter have further indicated that the complexity and age of organic matter increase with decreasing molecular size. Biodegradation processes appear to shape the size distribution of organic matter and the nature of the small dissolved molecules that persist in the ocean.

N2  - As knowledge of contaminants capable of adversely modulating endocrine functions increases, attention is focused on the effects of synthetic progestins as environmental endocrine disrupters. In the present study, effects of exposure to a synthetic progestin (norethindrone, 168 ± 7.5 ng/L) and endogenous progestogen (progesterone, 34 ± 4.1 ng/L) on steroidogenesis in adult female fathead minnows were examined. In vivo exposure to either compound lowered expression (nonsignificant) of luteinizing hormone (LHβ) levels in the brain along with significantly down-regulating the beta isoform of membrane progesterone receptor (mPRβ) in ovary tissue. The correspondence between lowered LHβ levels in the brain and mPRβ in the ovary is suggestive of a possible functional association as positive correlations between LHβ and mPR levels have been demonstrated in other fish species. In vitro exposure of ovary tissue to progesterone resulted in significantly elevated progestogen (pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone) and androgen (testosterone) production. Whereas in vitro exposure to norethindrone did not significantly impact steroid hormone production but showed decreased testosterone production relative to solvent control (however this was not significant). Overall, this study showed that exposure to a natural progestogen (progesterone) and synthetic progestin (norethindrone), was capable of modulating LHβ (in brain) and mPRβ expression (in ovary).

N2  - Unlike their terrestrial ancestors, marine mammals routinely confront extreme physiological and physical challenges while breath-holding and pursuing prey at depth. To determine how cetaceans and pinnipeds accomplish deep-sea chases, we deployed animal-borne instruments that recorded high-resolution electrocardiograms, behaviour and flipper accelerations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) diving from the surface to >200 m. Here we report that both exercise and depth alter the bradycardia associated with the dive response, with the greatest impacts at depths inducing lung collapse. Unexpectedly, cardiac arrhythmias occurred in >73% of deep, aerobic dives, which we attribute to the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic drivers for exercise and diving, respectively. Such marked cardiac variability alters the common view of a stereotypic 'dive reflex' in diving mammals. It also suggests the persistence of ancestral terrestrial traits in cardiac function that may help explain the unique sensitivity of some deep-diving marine mammals to anthropogenic disturbances.

N2  - Ontogenetic niche shifts are common among animals, yet most studies only investigate niche shifts at the population level, which may overlook considerable differences among individuals in the timing and dynamics of these shifts. Such divergent behaviors within size-/age-classes have important implications for the roles a population-and specific age-classes-play in their respective ecosystem(s). Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked the movements of juvenile bull sharks in the Shark River Estuary of Everglades National Park, Florida, and found that sharks increased their use of marine microhabitats with age to take advantage of more abundant resources, but continued to use freshwater and estuarine microhabitats as refuges from marine predators. Within this population-level ontogenetic niche shift, however, movement patterns varied among individual sharks, with 47 % of sharks exhibiting condition-dependent habitat use and 53 % appearing risk-averse regardless of body condition. Among sharks older than age 0, fifty percent made regular movements between adjacent regions of the estuary, while the other half made less predictable movements that often featured long-term residence in specific regions. Individual differences were apparently shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including individual responses to food-risk trade-offs and body condition. These differences appear to develop early in the lives of bull sharks, and persist throughout their residencies in nursery habitats. The widespread occurrence of intraspecific variation in behavior among mobile taxa suggests it is important in shaping population dynamics of at least some species, and elucidating the contexts and timing in which it develops and persists is important for understanding its role within communities.

N2  - Annual variations in biogeochemical and physical processes can lead to nutrient variability and seasonal patterns in phytoplankton productivity and assemblage structure. In many coastal systems river inflow and water exchange with the ocean varies seasonally, and alternating periods can arise where the nutrient most limiting to phytoplankton growth switches. Transitions between these alternating periods can be sudden or gradual and this depends on human activities, such as reservoir construction and interbasin water transfers. How such activities might influence phytoplankton assemblages is largely unknown. Here, we employed a multispecies, multi-nutrient model to explore how nutrient loading switching mode might affect characteristics of phytoplankton assemblages. The model is based on the Monod-relationship, predicting an instantaneous growth rate from ambient inorganic nutrient concentrations whereas the limiting nutrient at any given time was determined by Liebig's Law of the Minimum. Our simulated phytoplankton assemblages self-organized from species rich pools over a 15-year period, and only the surviving species were considered as assemblage members. Using the model, we explored the interactive effects of complementarity level in trait trade-offs within phytoplankton assemblages and the amount of noise in the resource supply concentrations. We found that the effect of shift from a sudden resource supply transition to a gradual one, as observed in systems impacted by watershed development, was dependent on the level of complementarity. In the extremes, phytoplankton species richness and relative overyielding increased when complementarity was lowest, and phytoplankton biomass increased greatly when complementarity was highest. For low-complementarity simulations, the persistence of poorer-performing phytoplankton species of intermediate R*s led to higher richness and relative overyielding. For high-complementarity simulations, the formation of phytoplankton species clusters and niche compression enabled higher biomass accumulation. Our findings suggest that an understanding of factors influencing the emergence of life history traits important to complementarity is necessary to predict the impact of watershed development on phytoplankton productivity and assemblage structure.

N2  - Coastal marine systems are affected by seasonal variations in biogeochemical and physical processes, sometimes leading to alternating periods of reproductive growth limitation within an annual cycle. Transitions between these periods can be sudden or gradual. Human activities, such as reservoir construction and interbasin water transfers, influence these processes and can affect the type of transition between resource loading conditions. How such human activities might influence phytoplankton succession is largely unknown. Here, we employ a multispecies, multi-nutrient model to explore how nutrient loading switching mode might affect phytoplankton succession. The model is based on the Monod-relationship, predicting an instantaneous reproductive growth rate from ambient inorganic nutrient concentrations whereas the limiting nutrient at any given time was determined by Liebig's Law of the Minimum. When these relationships are combined with population loss factors, such as hydraulic displacement of cells associated with inflows, a characterization of a species' niche can be achieved through application of the R* conceptual model, thus enabling an ecological interpretation of modeling results. We found that the mode of reversal in resource supply concentrations had a profound effect. When resource supply reversals were sudden, as expected in systems influenced by pulsed inflows or wind-driven mixing events, phytoplankton were characterized by alternating succession dynamics, a phenomenon documented in inland water bodies of temperate latitudes. When resource supply reversals were gradual, as expected in systems influenced by seasonally developing wet and dry seasons, or annually occurring periods of upwelling, phytoplankton dynamics were characterized by mirror-image succession patterns. This phenomenon has not been reported previously in plankton systems but has been observed in some terrestrial plant systems. These findings suggest that a transition from alternating to "mirror-image" succession patterns might arise with continued coastal zone development, with crucial implications for ecosystems dependent on time-sensitive processes, e.g., spawning events and migration patterns.

N2  - Viral infections dynamically alter the composition and metabolic potential of marine microbial communities and the evolutionary trajectories of host populations with resulting feedback on biogeochemical cycles. It is quite possible that all microbial populations in the ocean are impacted by viral infections. Our knowledge of virus-host relationships, however, has been limited to a minute fraction of cultivated host groups. Here, we utilized single-cell sequencing to obtain genomic blueprints of viruses inside or attached to individual bacterial and archaeal cells captured in their native environment, circumventing the need for host and virus cultivation. A combination of comparative genomics, metagenomic fragment recruitment, sequence anomalies and irregularities in sequence coverage depth and genome recovery were utilized to detect viruses and to decipher modes of virus-host interactions. Members of all three tailed phage families were identified in 20 out of 58 phylogenetically and geographically diverse single amplified genomes (SAGs) of marine bacteria and archaea. At least four phage-host interactions had the characteristics of late lytic infections, all of which were found in metabolically active cells. One virus had genetic potential for lysogeny. Our findings include first known viruses of Thaumarchaeota, Marinimicrobia, Verrucomicrobia and Gammaproteobacteria clusters SAR86 and SAR92. Viruses were also found in SAGs of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. A high fragment recruitment of viral metagenomic reads confirmed that most of the SAG-associated viruses are abundant in the ocean. Our study demonstrates that single-cell genomics, in conjunction with sequence-based computational tools, enable in situ, cultivation-independent insights into host-virus interactions in complex microbial communities.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While a number of neuroanatomical studies in other malacostracan taxa have recently contributed to the reconstruction of the malacostracan ground pattern, little is known about the nervous system in the three enigmatic blind groups of peracarids from relict habitats, Thermosbaenacea, Spelaeogriphacea, and Mictocarididae. This first detailed description of the brain in a representative of each taxon is largely based on a combination of serial semi-thin sectioning and computer-aided 3D-reconstructions. In addition, the mictocaridid Mictocaris halope was studied with a combination of immunolabeling (tubulin, nuclear counter-stains) and confocal laser scanning microscopy, addressing also the ventral nerve cord. RESULTS: Adjacent to the terminal medulla, all three representatives exhibit a distal protocerebral neuropil, which is reminiscent of the lobula in other Malacostraca, but also allows for an alternative interpretation in M. halope and the thermosbaenacean Tethysbaena argentarii. A central complex occurs in all three taxa, most distinctively in the spelaeogriphacean Spelaeogriphus lepidops. The deutocerebral olfactory lobe in M. halope and S. lepidops is large. The comparably smaller olfactory lobe in T. argentarii appears to be associated with a unique additional deutocerebral neuropil. A small hemiellipsoid body exists only in the protocerebrum of T. argentarii. Distinctive mechanosensory neuropils corresponding to other malacostracans are missing. CONCLUSIONS: The considerable reduction of the optic lobe in the studied taxa is higher than in any other blind malacostracan. The large size of deutocerebral olfactory centers implies an important role of the olfactory sense. The presence of a distinctive central complex in the blind S. lepidops adds further support to a central-coordinating over a visual function of this structure. The lack of a hemiellipsoid body in M. halope and S. lepidops suggests that their terminal medulla takes over the function of a second order olfactory center completely, as in some other peracarids. The reduction of the optic lobe and hemiellipsoid body is suggested to have occurred several times independently within Peracarida. The missing optic sense in the studied taxa is not correlated with an emphasized mechanosense.

N2  - β₃-adrenergic receptors (AR) are important in teleost cardiovascular regulation. To date, it is unknown whether temperature acclimation changes ß₃-AR functionality and consequently the involvement of this AR subtype in teleost cardiac regulation. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were acclimated at 12 °C or 23 °C (minimum 3 weeks) after which cardiovascular variables (cardiac output (Q), stroke volume (Sv) and heart rate (fH)) were measured upon injection of the ß₃-AR agonist, BRL(37344), and antagonist, SR(59230A). In both 12 °C and 23 °C acclimated carp, BRL(37344) induced significant increases in fH and Q whereas Sv was significantly decreased. While temperature did not affect the change (increase vs. decrease) in cardiac variables, the magnitude and on-set of responses differed. For instance, fH, Sv and Q responded significantly faster to ß₃-AR stimulation in 23 °C carp. In contrast, maximum responses of fH and Q were significantly higher in 23 °C carp whereas the maximum response of Sv was significantly greater in 12 °C carp. These findings suggest that temperature acclimation induced changes in β₃-AR receptor functionality (e.g. density and/or affinity). Stimulation of β₃-ARs in 23 °C acclimated channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) caused significant increases in fH, Sv and Q. The increase in Sv was opposite to the decrease observed in 23 °C acclimated common carp. SR(59230A) induced significant decreases in Sv and Q but had no effect in carp (23 °C). Results suggest species diversity in the density and affinity or structure of ß₃-ARs which may explain the different cardiac responses to ß₃-AR ligands.

N2  - Metagenomic studies have revealed that ssDNA phages from the family Microviridae subfamily Gokushovirinae are widespread in aquatic ecosystems. It is hypothesized that gokushoviruses occupy specialized niches, resulting in differences among genotypes traversing water column gradients. Here, we use degenerate primers that amplify a fragment of the gene encoding the major capsid protein to examine the diversity of gokushoviruses in Saanich Inlet (SI), a seasonally anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. Amplicon sequencing of samples from the mixed oxic surface (10 m) and deeper anoxic (200 m) layers indicated a diverse assemblage of gokushoviruses, with greater richness at 10 m than 200 m. A comparison of amplicon sequences with sequences selected on the basis of RFLP patterns from eight surface samples collected over a 1-year period revealed that gokushovirus diversity was higher in spring and summer during stratification and lower in fall and winter after deep-water renewal, consistent with seasonal variability within gokushovirus populations. Our results provide persuasive evidence that, while specific gokushovirus genotypes may have a narrow host range, hosts for gokushoviruses in SI consist of a wide range of bacterial taxa. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis of clustered amplicons revealed at least five new phylogenetic groups of previously unknown sequences, with the most abundant group associated with viruses infecting SUP05, a ubiquitous and abundant member of marine oxygen minimum zones. Relatives of SUP05 dominate the anoxic SI waters where they drive coupled carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur transformations along the redoxline; thus, gokushoviruses are likely important mortality agents of these bacteria with concomittant influences on biogeochemical cycling in marine oxygen minimum zones.

N2  - A major fraction of Earth's prokaryotic biomass dwells in the deep subsurface, where cellular abundances per volume of sample are lower, metabolism is slower, and generation times are longer than those in surface terrestrial and marine environments. How these conditions impact biotic interactions and evolutionary processes is largely unknown. Here we employed single cell genomics to analyze cell-to-cell genome content variability and signatures of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and viral infections in five cells of Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator, which were collected from a 3 km-deep fracture water in the 2.9 Ga-old Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa. Between 0 and 32% of genes recovered from single cells were not present in the original, metagenomic assembly of Desulforudis, which was obtained from a neighboring subsurface fracture. We found a transposable prophage, a retron, multiple clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and restriction-modification systems, and an unusually high frequency of transposases in the analyzed single cell genomes. This indicates that recombination, HGT and viral infections are prevalent evolutionary events in the studied population of microorganisms inhabiting a highly stable deep subsurface environment.

N2  - The Thermosbaenacea, a small taxon of crustaceans inhabiting subterranean waters, are unique among malacostracans as they brood their offspring dorsally under the carapace. This habit is of evolutionary interest but the last detailed report on thermosbaenacean development is more than 40 years old. Here we provide new observations on an ovigerous female of Tulumella unidens with advanced developmental stages in its brood chamber collected from an anchialine cave at the Yucatan Peninsula, which is only the third report on developmental stages of Thermosbaenacea and the first for the genus Tulumella. Significant in a wider crustacean context, we report and discuss hitherto unexplored lobate structures inside the brood chamber of the female originating at the first (maxilliped) and second thoracic segments, which are most likely modified epipods, perhaps serving as gills. At the posterior margin of carapace of the female are rows of large spines preventing the developing stages from falling out. The external morphology of the advanced developmental stages is described in much detail, providing information on e.g., carapace formation and early limb morphology. Among the hitherto unknown structures in the advanced developmental stages provided by this study are the presence of an embryonic dorsal organ and rudimentary 'naupliar processes' of the second antennae. Since most hypotheses on crustacean (and malacostracan and peracaridan) relationship rest on external limb morphology, we use early limb bud morphology of Tulumella to better establish thermosbaenacean limb homologies to those of other crustaceans, which is a necessary basis for future morphology based phylogenetic considerations.

N2  - Foraging by large (>25 kg), mammalian carnivores often entails cryptic tactics to surreptitiously locate and overcome highly mobile prey. Many forms of intermittent locomotion from stroke-and-glide maneuvers by marine mammals to sneak-and-pounce behaviors by terrestrial canids, ursids, and felids are involved. While affording proximity to vigilant prey, these tactics are also associated with unique energetic costs and benefits to the predator. We examined the energetic consequences of intermittent locomotion in mammalian carnivores and assessed the role of these behaviors in overall foraging efficiency. Behaviorally-linked, three-axis accelerometers were calibrated to provide instantaneous locomotor behaviors and associated energetic costs for wild adult Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) diving beneath the Antarctic ice. The results were compared with previously published values for other marine and terrestrial carnivores. We found that intermittent locomotion in the form of extended glides, burst-and-glide swimming, and rollercoaster maneuvers while hunting silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) resulted in a marked energetic savings for the diving seals relative to continuously stroking. The cost of a foraging dive by the seals decreased by 9.2-59.6%, depending on the proportion of time gliding. These energetic savings translated into exceptionally low transport costs during hunting (COTHUNT) for diving mammals. COTHUNT for Weddell seals was nearly six times lower than predicted for large terrestrial carnivores, and demonstrates the importance of turning off the propulsive machinery to facilitate cost-efficient foraging in highly active, air-breathing marine predators.

N2  - The multi-factorial nature of adverse reproductive effects mediated by endocrine disrupting compounds (or EDCs) makes understanding the mechanistic basis of reproductive dysfunction a highly pertinent area of research. As a consequence, a main motivator for continued research is to integrate 'multi-leveled' complexity (i.e., from genes to phenotype) using mathematical methods capable of encapsulating properties of physiological relevance. In this study, an in silico stoichiometric model of piscine steroidogenesis was augmented with a 'biomass' reaction associating the underlying stoichiometry of steroidogenesis with a reaction representative of gonad growth. The ability of the in silico model to predict perturbed steroidogenesis and subsequent effects on gonad growth was tested by exposing reproductively active male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to 88 ng/L of the synthetic estrogen, 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2). The in silico model was parameterized (or constrained) with experimentally quantified concentrations of selected steroid hormones (using mass spectrometry) and fold changes in gene expression (using RT-qPCR) for selected steroidogenic enzyme genes, in gonads of male and female fish. Once constrained, the optimization framework of flux balance analysis (FBA) was used to calculate an optimal flux through the biomass reaction (analogous to gonad growth) and associated steroidogenic flux distributions required to generate biomass. FBA successfully predicted effects of EE2 exposure on fathead minnow gonad growth (%gonadosomatic index or %GSI) and perturbed production of steroid hormones. Specifically, FBA accurately predicted no effects of exposure on male %GSI and a significant reduction for female %GSI. Furthermore, in silico simulations accurately identified disrupted reaction fluxes catalyzing productions of androgens (in male fish) and progestogens (in female fish), an observation which agreed with in vivo experimentation. The analyses presented is the first-ever to successfully associate underlying flux properties of the steroidogenic network with gonad growth in fish, an approach which can incorporate in silico predictions with toxicological risk assessments.

N2  - Landscape-level shifts in plant species distribution and abundance can fundamentally change the ecology of an ecosystem. Such shifts are occurring within mangrove-marsh ecotones, where over the last few decades, relatively mild winters have led to mangrove expansion into areas previously occupied by salt marsh plants. On the Texas (USA) coast of the western Gulf of Mexico, most cases of mangrove expansion have been documented within specific bays or watersheds. Based on this body of relatively small-scale work and broader global patterns of mangrove expansion, we hypothesized that there has been a recent regional-level displacement of salt marshes by mangroves. We classified Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images using artificial neural networks to quantify black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) expansion and salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora and other grass and forb species) loss over 20 years across the entire Texas coast. Between 1990 and 2010, mangrove area grew by 16.1 km(2), a 74% increase. Concurrently, salt marsh area decreased by 77.8 km(2), a 24% net loss. Only 6% of that loss was attributable to mangrove expansion; most salt marsh was lost due to conversion to tidal flats or water, likely a result of relative sea level rise. Our research confirmed that mangroves are expanding and, in some instances, displacing salt marshes at certain locations. However, this shift is not widespread when analyzed at a larger, regional level. Rather, local, relative sea level rise was indirectly implicated as another important driver causing regional-level salt marsh loss. Climate change is expected to accelerate both sea level rise and mangrove expansion; these mechanisms are likely to interact synergistically and contribute to salt marsh loss.

N2  - In June 2013, a record-breaking female Isurus oxyrinchus (total length 373 cm, mass 600 kg) was captured by rod and reel off Huntington Beach, California, where it was subsequently donated to research and provided a rare opportunity to collect the first data for a female I. oxyrinchus of this size. Counts of vertebral band pairs estimate the shark to have been c. 22 years old, depending upon assumptions of band-pair deposition rates, and the distended uteri and spent ovaries indicated that this shark had recently given birth. The stomach contained a c. 4 year-old female California sea lion Zalophus californianus that confirmed the high trophic position of this large I. oxyrinchus, which was corroborated with the high levels of measured contaminants and tissue isotope analyses.

N2  - Mass mortalities in natural populations, particularly those that leave few survivors over large spatial areas, may cause long-term ecological perturbations. Yet mass mortalities may remain undocumented or poorly described due to challenges in responding rapidly to unforeseen events, scarcity of baseline data, and difficulties in quantifying rare or patchily distributed species, especially in remote or marine systems. Better chronicling the geographic pattern and intensity of mass mortalities is especially critical in the face of global changes predicted to alter regional disturbance regimes. Here, we couple replicated post-mortality surveys with preceding long-term surveys and historical data to describe a rapid and severe mass mortality of rocky shore invertebrates along the north-central California coast of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. In late August 2011, formerly abundant intertidal populations of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a well-known ecosystem engineer), and the predatory six-armed sea star (Leptasterias sp.) were functionally extirpated from ~100 km of coastline. Other invertebrates, including the gumboot chiton (Cryptochiton stelleri) the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus), and subtidal populations of purple sea urchins also exhibited elevated mortality. The pattern and extent of mortality suggest the potential for long-term population, community, and ecosystem consequences, recovery from which may depend on the different dispersal abilities of the affected species.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress towards resolution of the Tree of Life. However, despite the increased use of genomic scale datasets, some phylogenetic relationships remain difficult to resolve. Here we employ anchored phylogenomics to capture 107 nuclear loci in 29 species of acanthomorph teleost fishes, with 25 of these species sampled from the recently delimited clade Ovalentaria. Previous studies employing multilocus nuclear exon datasets have not been able to resolve the nodes at the base of the Ovalentaria tree with confidence. Here we test whether a phylogenomic approach will provide better support for these nodes, and if not, why this may be. RESULTS: After using a novel method to account for paralogous loci, we estimated phylogenies with maximum likelihood and species tree methods using DNA sequence alignments of over 80,000 base pairs. Several key relationships within Ovalentaria are well resolved, including 1) the sister taxon relationship between Cichlidae and Pholidichthys, 2) a clade containing blennies, grammas, clingfishes, and jawfishes, and 3) monophyly of Atherinomorpha (topminnows, flyingfishes, and silversides). However, many nodes in the phylogeny associated with the early diversification of Ovalentaria are poorly resolved in several analyses. Through the use of rarefaction curves we show that limited phylogenetic resolution among the earliest nodes in the Ovalentaria phylogeny does not appear to be due to a deficiency of data, as average global node support ceases to increase when only 1/3rd of the sampled loci are used in analyses. Instead this lack of resolution may be driven by model misspecification as a Bayesian mixed model analysis of the amino acid dataset provided good support for parts of the base of the Ovalentaria tree. CONCLUSIONS: Although it does not appear that the limited phylogenetic resolution among the earliest nodes in the Ovalentaria phylogeny is due to a deficiency of data, it may be that both stochastic and systematic error resulting from model misspecification play a role in the poor resolution at the base of the Ovalentaria tree as a Bayesian approach was able to resolve some of the deeper nodes, where the other methods failed.

N2  - Vibrissae are important components of the mammalian tactile sensory system and are used to detect vibrotactile stimuli in the environment. Pinnipeds have the largest and most highly innervated vibrissae among mammals, and the hair shafts function as a biomechanical filter spanning the environmental stimuli and the neural mechanoreceptors deep in the follicle-sinus complex. Therefore, the material properties of these structures are critical in transferring vibrotactile information to the peripheral nervous system. Vibrissae were tested as cantilever beams and their flexural stiffness (EI) was measured to test the hypotheses that the shape of beaded vibrissae reduces EI and that vibrissae are anisotropic. EI was measured at two locations on each vibrissa, 25% and 50% of the overall length, and at two orientations to the point force. EI differed in orientations that were normal to each other, indicating a functional anisotropy. Since vibrissae taper from base to tip, the second moment of area (I) was lower at 50% than 25% of total length. The anterior orientation exhibited greater EI values at both locations compared to the dorsal orientation for all species. Smooth vibrissae were generally stiffer than beaded vibrissae. The profiles of beaded vibrissae are known to decrease the amplitude of vibrations when protruded into a flow field. The lower EI values of beaded vibrissae, along with the reduced vibrations, may function to enhance the sensitivity of mechanoreceptors to detection of small changes in flow from swimming prey by increasing the signal to noise ratio. This study builds upon previous morphological and hydrodynamic analyses of vibrissae and is the first comparative study of the mechanical properties of pinniped vibrissae.

N2  - Subtropical estuaries worldwide face increased pressure on their ecosystem health and services due to increasing human population growth and associated land use/land cover changes, expansion of ports, and climate change. We investigated freshwater inflows (river discharge) and the physico-chemical characteristics of Galveston Bay (Texas, USA) as mechanisms driving variability in phytoplankton biomass and community composition between February 2008 and December 2009. Results of multivariate analyses (hierarchical cluster analysis, PERMANOVA, Mantel test, and nMDS ordination coupled to environmental vector fitting) revealed that temporal and spatial differences in phytoplankton community structure correlate to differences in hydrographic and water quality parameters. Spatially, phytoplankton biomass and community composition responded to nutrient loading from the San Jacinto River in the northwest region of the bay (consistent with nutrient limitation) while hydraulic displacement (and perhaps other processes) resulted in overall lower biomass in the Trinity River delta (northeast region). The influence of inflows on phytoplankton diminished along a north to south gradient in the bay. Temporally, temperature and variables associated with freshwater inflow (discharge volume, salinity, inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) were major influences on phytoplankton dynamics. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen: phosphorus (DIN:DIP) ratios suggest that phytoplankton communities will be predominately nitrogen limited. Diatoms dominated during periods of moderate to high freshwater inflows in winter/spring and were more abundant in the upper bay while cyanobacteria dominated during summer/fall when inflow was low. Given the differential influences of freshwater inflow on the phytoplankton communities of Galveston Bay, alterations upstream (magnitude, timing, frequency) will likely have a profound effect on downstream ecological processes and corresponding ecosystem services.

By tailoring the orientation of the graphene ribbons with respect to an array of subwavelength bimetallic electrodes, we achieve a condition in which the plasmonic mode can be efficiently excited by an incident wave polarized perpendicular to the electrode array, while the resulting photothermal voltage can be observed between the outermost electrodes.

N2  - Anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is being absorbed by seawater resulting in increasingly acidic oceans, a process known as ocean acidification (OA). OA is thought to have largely deleterious effects on marine invertebrates, primarily impacting early life stages and consequently, their recruitment and species' survival. Most research in this field has been limited to short-term, single-species and single-life stage studies, making it difficult to determine which taxa will be evolutionarily successful under OA conditions. We circumvent these limitations by relating the dominance and distribution of the known polychaete worm species living in a naturally acidic seawater vent system to their life history strategies. These data are coupled with breeding experiments, showing all dominant species in this natural system exhibit parental care. Our results provide evidence supporting the idea that long-term survival of marine species in acidic conditions is related to life history strategies where eggs are kept in protected maternal environments (brooders) or where larvae have no free swimming phases (direct developers). Our findings are the first to formally validate the hypothesis that species with life history strategies linked to parental care are more protected in an acidifying ocean compared to their relatives employing broadcast spawning and pelagic larval development.

N2  - The response of N (nitrate) starved cells of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi to a pulse of new N were measured to investigate rapid cellular and photosynthetic recovery kinetics. The changes of multiple parameters were followed over 24 h. In P. tricornutum, the recovery of Fv /Fm (the maximum quantum yield of PS II) and σPSII (the functional absorption cross-section for PSII) started within the first hour, much earlier than other parameters. Cellular pigments did not recover during the 24 h but the chlorophyll (chl) a/carotenoid ratios increased to levels measured in the controls. Cell division was independent of the recovery of chl a. In E. huxleyi, the recovery of Fv /Fm and σPSII started after an hour, synchronous with the increase in cellular organic N and chl a with pigments fully recovered within 14 h. P. tricornutum prioritized the recovery of its photosynthetic functions and cell divisions while E. huxleyi did not follow this pattern. We hypothesize that the different recovery strategies between the two species allow P. tricornutum to be more competitive when N pulses are introduced into N-limited water while E. huxleyi is adapted to N scarce waters where such pulses are infrequent. These findings are consistent with successional patterns observed in coastal environments. This is one of only a few studies exploring recovery kinetics of cellular functions and photosynthesis after nitrogen stress in phytoplankton. Our results can be used to enhance ecological models linking phytoplankton traits to species diversity and community structure.

N2  - The percomorph fish clade Gobiiformes is a worldwide, tropical and temperate radiation with species occupying nearly all aquatic, and some semi-terrestrial, habitats. Early molecular phylogenetic studies led to the discovery of Gobiiformes, which contains Gobioidei, the gobies and sleepers, and a clade (Apogonoidei) consisting of Apogonidae and Kurtus, the cardinalfishes and nurseryfishes. Gobioidei is consistently resolved as monophyletic in molecular studies, and includes eight families whose members range from waterfall climbing stream gobies to several prominent lineages inhabiting coral reefs. The sister taxon to Gobioidei is also reliably resolved as Apogonoidei. Despite the consistent support for gobiiform monophyly in molecular studies, it is not known if percomorph lineages unsampled in molecular phylogenetic studies are closely related to Gobioidei or Apogonoidei. Here we assemble a large dataset of DNA sequence from ten protein-coding genes, sampling widely across Acanthomorpha and Percomorpha, including Gobioidei, Apogonidae, and Kurtus, along with representatives of all twelve families comprising the former Trachinoidei. The phylogenies inferred from the nuclear gene sequences show that Trachinoidei is polyphyletic, with constituent lineages spread widely among several major percomorph clades. Most notably, the sanddivers (Trichonotus) are resolved as the sister lineage of Gobioidei. This study clarifies the phylogenetic relationships of lineages previously classified in Trachinoidei, identifies Trichonotus as the sister lineage of gobies, provides a molecular phylogeny of the major lineages of Gobioidei, and offers suggested changes to percomorph classification.

N2  - Exceptionally well-preserved organic remains of thecamoebians (testate amoebae) were preserved in marine sediments that straddle the greatest extinction event in the Phanerozoic: the Permian-Triassic Boundary. Outcrops from the Late Permian Zewan Formation and the Early Triassic Khunamuh Formation are represented by a complete sedimentary sequence at the Guryul Ravine Section in Kashmir, India, which is an archetypal Permian-Triassic boundary sequence. Previous biostratigraphic analysis provides chronological control for the section, and a perspective of faunal turnover in the brachiopods, ammonoids, bivalves, conodonts, gastropods and foraminifera. Thecamoebians were concentrated from bulk sediments using palynological procedures, which isolated the organic constituents of preserved thecamoebian tests. The recovered individuals demonstrate exceptional similarity to the modern thecamoebian families Centropyxidae, Arcellidae, Hyalospheniidae and Trigonopyxidae, however, the vast majority belong to the Centropyxidae. This study further confirms the morphologic stability of the thecamoebian lineages through the Phanerozoic, and most importantly, their apparent little response to an infamous biological crisis in Earth's history.

N2  - The incidence of cardiovascular disease in humans is more than three times that of many wild and domestic mammals despite nearly identical heart morphologies and responses to exercise. A survey of mammalian species from 0.002-kg shrews to 43,000-kg whales shows that the human heart is more dog-like than cat-like and that neither body size nor longevity accounts for the relative vulnerability to cardiovascular disease. Rather, a major difference is daily activity patterns, which may underlie the comparatively healthy hearts of wild mammals.

N2  - The Remipedia have been proposed to be the crustacean sister group of the Hexapoda. These blind cave animals heavily rely on their chemical sense and are thus rewarding subjects for the analysis of olfactory pathways. The evolution of these pathways as a character for arthropod phylogeny has recently received increasing attention. Here, we investigate the situation in Xibalbanus tulumensis by focal dye injections and immunolabelling of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (DC0), an enzyme particularly enriched in insect mushroom bodies. DC0 labelling of the hemiellipsoid body suggests its subdivision into a cap-like and a core neuropil. Immunofluorescence of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which synthesizes γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), has revealed a cluster of GABAergic interneurons in the hemiellipsoid body, reminiscent of the characteristic feedback neurons of the mushroom body. Thus, the hemiellipsoid body of Xibalbanus shares many of the characteristics of insect mushroom bodies. Nevertheless, the general neuroanatomy of the olfactory pathway in the Remipedia strongly corresponds to the malacostracan ground pattern. Given that the Remipedia are probably the sister group of the Hexapoda, the phylogenetic appearance of the typical neuropilar compartments in the insect mushroom body has to be assigned to the origins of the Hexapoda.

N2  - In many marine ecosystems, diatoms dominate in nutrient-rich coastal waters while coccolithiophores are found offshore in areas where nutrients may be limiting. In lab-controlled batch cultures, mixed-species competition between the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the coccolithophore Emiliana huxleyi and the response of each species were examined under nitrate (N) and phosphate (P) starvation. Based on the logistic growth model and the Lotka-Volterra competition model, E. huxleyi showed higher competitive abilities than P. tricornutum under N and P starvation. For both species, cell growth was more inhibited by P starvation, while photosynthetic functions (chl a fluorescence parameters) and cellular constituents (pigments) were impaired by N starvation. The decline of photosynthetic functions occurred later in E. huxleyi (day 12) than in P. tricornutum (day 9); this time difference was associated with greater damage of the photosynthetic apparatus in P. tricornutum compared with E. huxleyi. Xanthophyll cycle pigment accumulation and the transformation from diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin was more active in E. huxleyi than P. tricornutum, under similar N and P starvation. We concluded that E. huxleyi and P. tricornutum have different mechanisms to allocate resources and energy under nutrient starvation. It appears that E. huxleyi has a more economic strategy to adapt to nutrient depleted environments than P. tricornutum. These findings provided additional evidence explaining how N versus P limitation differentially support diatom and coccolithophore blooms in natural environments.

N2  - Mesoscale circulation generated by the Loop Current in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) delivers growth-limiting nutrients to the microbial plankton of the euphotic zone. Consequences of physicochemically driven community shifts on higher order consumers and subsequent impacts on the biological carbon pump remain poorly understood. This study evaluates microbial plankton <10 μm abundance and community structure across both cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulation features in the NGOM using flow cytometry (SYBR Green I and autofluorescence parameters). Non-parametric multivariate hierarchical cluster analyses indicated that significant spatial variability in community structure exists such that stations that clustered together were defined as having a specific 'microbial signature' (i.e. statistically homogeneous community structure profiles based on relative abundance of microbial groups). Salinity and a combination of sea surface height anomaly and sea surface temperature were determined by distance based linear modeling to be abiotic predictor variables significantly correlated to changes in microbial signatures. Correlations between increased microbial abundance and availability of nitrogen suggest nitrogen-limitation of microbial plankton in this open ocean area. Regions of combined coastal water entrainment and mesoscale convergence corresponded to increased heterotrophic prokaryote abundance relative to autotrophic plankton. The results provide an initial assessment of how mesoscale circulation potentially influences microbial plankton abundance and community structure in the NGOM.

N2  - A total of 36 lots of Palola spp. (Eunicidae, Annelida) were collected during the Lizard Island Polychaete Workshop on Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Of these, 21 specimens were sequenced for a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene. These sequences were analysed in conjunction with existing sequences of Palola spp. from other geographic regions. The samples from Lizard Island form six distinct clades, although none of them can clearly be assigned to any of the nominal species. Four of the six Lizard Island clades fall into species group A and the remaining two into species group B (which also includes the type species, Palola viridis). All sequenced specimens were characterized morphologically as far as possible and a dichotomous key was assembled. Based on this key, the remaining samples were identified as belonging to one of the clades.

N2  - Anthropogenic noise in the ocean has increased substantially in recent decades, and motorized vessels produce what is likely the most common form of underwater noise pollution. Noise has the potential to induce physiological stress in marine fishes, which may have negative ecological consequences. In this study, physiological effects of increased noise (playback of boat noise recorded in the field) on a coastal marine fish (the giant kelpfish, Heterostichus rostratus) were investigated by measuring the stress responses (cortisol concentration) of fish to increased noise of various temporal dynamics and noise levels. Giant kelpfish exhibited acute stress responses when exposed to intermittent noise, but not to continuous noise or control conditions (playback of recorded natural ambient sound). These results suggest that variability in the acoustic environment may be more important than the period of noise exposure for inducing stress in a marine fish, and provide information regarding noise levels at which physiological responses occur.

               <jats:p>Juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna (PBT, Thunnus orientalis) are known to migrate from western Pacific spawning grounds to their eastern Pacific nursery and feeding grounds in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), but the timing, durations, and fraction of the population that makes these migrations need to be better understood for improved management. To complement recent work focused on stable isotope and radiotracer approaches (“tracer toolbox”; Madigan et al., 2014) we explored the suitability of combining longitudinal analyses of otolith microstructure and trace elemental composition in age ∼1–2 PBT (n = 24, 66–76 cm curved fork length) for inferring the arrival of individuals in the CCLME. Element:Ca ratios in transverse otolith sections (9–12 rows, triplicate ablations from primordium to edge, ø50 μm) were quantified for eight elements: Li, Mg, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, and Ba, which was followed by microstructure analysis to provide age estimates corresponding to each ablation spot. Age estimates from otoliths ranged from 328 to 498 d post-hatch. The combined elemental signatures of four elements (Ba, Mg, Co, Cu) showed a significant increase at the otolith edge in approximately half of the individuals (30–60 d before catch). Given the different oceanographic properties of oligotrophic open Pacific vs. high nutrient, upwelling CCLME waters, this signal is consistent with the entry of the fish into the CCLME, which was estimated to occur primarily in July after a transoceanic migration of ∼1.5–2.0 months. Our approach comprises a useful addition to the available tracer toolbox and can provide additional and complementary understanding of trans-Pacific migration patterns in PBT.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>Chemical signatures in otoliths and muscle tissue of albacore (Thunnus alalunga) from two regions of the North Pacific were characterized to examine population structure. Regions included northern (offshore northwest United States and Canada, &amp;gt;40°N) and southern (offshore southwest United States and Mexico, &amp;lt;40°N) areas where albacore have demonstrated region-specific differences in movement and size at age. Juvenile (ages 1–4 years) albacore were collected from each region through recreational and commercial fisheries over a 5-year period (2009–2013). Three different otolith chemistry assays were performed, including whole otoliths (proxy for lifetime signature), otolith edge (recent signature), and otolith core (nursery signature). Whole otolith δ13C and δ18O showed similar δ13C and enriched δ18O (∼0.5‰) values for juvenile albacore collected in the southern region; classification success to the two regions ranged from 78 to 91% during each year (similar age classes). Otolith edge δ13C and δ18O showed similar results as whole otoliths, but no regional differences were found for otolith core chemistry. Incorporation of trace element concentrations from whole otoliths improved discrimination between regions to 90–100% classification success during each year of the study, with significantly higher Ba:Ca, Mg:Ca, and Mn:Ca in albacore otoliths from the northern region. Albacore from the southern region also displayed enriched muscle δ13C (∼1.21‰) and δ15N (∼0.85‰) values relative to fish of the same size range from the northern region. Discrimination success between the two regions across all years using muscle δ13C and δ15N was 91%. Ultimately, results from this study suggest regional separation of albacore in the eastern North Pacific warranting region-specific vital rates in future modelling efforts.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. The carbon sequestration potential in coastal soils is linked to aboveground and belowground plant productivity and biomass, which in turn, is directly and indirectly influenced by nutrient input. We evaluated the influence of long-term and near-term nutrient input on aboveground and belowground carbon accumulation in seagrass beds, using a nutrient enrichment (nitrogen and phosphorus) experiment embedded within a naturally occurring, long-term gradient of phosphorus availability within Florida Bay (USA). We measured organic carbon stocks in soils and above- and belowground seagrass biomass after 17 months of experimental nutrient addition. At the nutrient-limited sites, phosphorus addition increased the carbon stock in aboveground seagrass biomass by more than 300 %; belowground seagrass carbon stock increased by 50–100 %. Soil carbon content slightly decreased (~ 10 %) in response to phosphorus addition. There was a strong but non-linear relationship between soil carbon and Thalassia testudinum leaf nitrogen: phosphorus (N : P) or belowground seagrass carbon stock. When seagrass leaf N : P exceeded a threshold of 75 : 1, or when belowground seagrass carbon stock was less than 100 g m−2, there was less than 3 % organic carbon in the sediment. Despite the marked difference in soil carbon between phosphorus-limited and phosphorus-replete areas of Florida Bay, all areas of the bay had relatively high soil carbon stocks near or above the global median of 1.8 % organic carbon. The relatively high carbon content in the soils indicates that seagrass beds have extremely high carbon storage potential, even in nutrient-limited areas with low biomass or productivity.

N2  - Pu concentrations in wetland surface sediments collected downstream of a former nuclear processing facility in F-Area of the Savannah River Site (SRS), USA, were ∼2.5 times greater than those measured in the associated upland aquifer sediments; similarly, the Pu concentration solid/water ratios were orders of magnitude greater in the wetland than in the low-organic matter content aquifer soils. Sediment Pu concentrations were correlated to total organic carbon and total nitrogen contents and even more strongly to hydroxamate siderophore (HS) concentrations. The HS were detected in the particulate or colloidal phases of the sediments but not in the low molecular weight fractions (<1000 Da). Macromolecules which scavenged the majority of the potentially mobile Pu were further separated from the bulk mobile organic matter fraction ("water extract") via an isoelectric focusing experiment (IEF). An electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (ESI FTICR-MS) spectral comparison of the IEF extract and a siderophore standard (desferrioxamine; DFO) suggested the presence of HS functionalities in the IEF extract. This study suggests that while HS are a very minor component in the sediment particulate/colloidal fractions, their concentrations greatly exceed those of ambient Pu, and HS may play an especially important role in Pu immobilization/remobilization in wetland sediments.

N2  - For centuries, the mechanisms surrounding spatially complex animal migrations have intrigued scientists and the public. We present a new methodology using ocean heat content (OHC), a habitat metric that is normally a fundamental part of hurricane intensity forecasting, to estimate movements and migration of satellite-tagged marine fishes. Previous satellite-tagging research of fishes using archival depth, temperature and light data for geolocations have been too coarse to resolve detailed ocean habitat utilization. We combined tag data with OHC estimated from ocean circulation and transport models in an optimization framework that substantially improved geolocation accuracy over SST-based tracks. The OHC-based movement track provided the first quantitative evidence that many of the tagged highly migratory fishes displayed affinities for ocean fronts and eddies. The OHC method provides a new quantitative tool for studying dynamic use of ocean habitats, migration processes and responses to environmental changes by fishes, and further, improves ocean animal tracking and extends satellite-based animal tracking data for other potential physical, ecological, and fisheries applications.

N2  - Globins, such as hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb), have gained attention for their ability to reduce nitrite (NO2(-)) to nitric oxide (NO). The molecular interactions that regulate this chemistry are not fully elucidated, therefore we address this issue by investigating one part of the active site that may control this reaction. Here, the effects of the 2,4-heme substituents on the nitrite reductase (NiR) reaction, and on the structures and energies of the ferrous nitrite intermediates, are investigated using Mb as a model system. This is accomplished by studying Mbs with hemes that have different 2,4-R groups, namely diacetyldeuteroMb (-acetyl), protoMb (wild-type (wt) Mb, -vinyl), deuteroMb (-H), and mesoMb (-ethyl). While trends on the natural charge on Fe and O-atom of bound nitrite are observed among the series of Mbs, the Fe(II)-NPyr (Pyr=pyrrole) and Fe(II)-NHis93 (His=histidine) bond lengths do not significantly change. Kinetic analysis shows increasing NiR activity as follows: diacetyldeuteroMb<wt Mb<deuteroMb<mesoMb. Nitrite binding energy calculations of the different Mb(II)-nitrite conformations demonstrate the N-bound complexes to be more stable than the O-bound complexes for all the different types of heme structures, with diacetyldeuteroMb having the greatest nitrite binding affinity. Spectral deconvolution on the final product generated from the reaction between Mb(II) and NO2(-) for the reconstituted Mbs indicates the formation of 1:1 Mb(III) and Mb(II)-NO. The electronic changes induced by the -R groups on the 2,4-positions do not alter the stoichiometric ratio of the products, resembling wt Mb.

N2  - Population consequences of endangered species interacting as predators and prey have been considered theoretically and legally, but rarely investigated in the field. We examined relationships between spatially variable populations of a predator, the California sea otter, Enhydra lutris nereis, and a prey species, the black abalone, Haliotis cracherodii. Both species are federally listed under the Endangered Species Act and co-occur along the coast of California. We compared the local abundance and habitat distribution of black abalone at 12 sites with varying densities of sea otters. All of the populations of abalone we examined were in the geographic area currently unaffected by withering disease, which has decimated populations south of the study area. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that sea otter density is positively associated with increased black abalone density. The presence of sea otters also correlated with a shift in black abalone to habitat conferring greater refuge, which could decrease illegal human harvest. These results highlight the need for a multi-species approach to conservation management of the two species, and demonstrate the importance of using field-collected data rather than simple trophic assumptions to understand relationships between jointly vulnerable predator and prey populations.

N2  - Climate change is expected to worsen the negative effects of natural disasters like floods. The negative impacts, however, can be mitigated by individuals' adjustments through migration and relocation behaviors. Previous literature has identified flood risk as one significant driver in relocation decisions, but no prior study examines the effect of the National Flood Insurance Program's voluntary program-the Community Rating System (CRS)-on residential location choice. This article fills this gap and tests the hypothesis that flood risk and the CRS-creditable flood control activities affect residential location choices. We employ a two-stage sorting model to empirically estimate the effects. In the first stage, individuals' risk perception and preference heterogeneity for the CRS activities are considered, while mean effects of flood risk and the CRS activities are estimated in the second stage. We then estimate heterogeneous marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for the CRS activities by category. Results show that age, ethnicity and race, educational attainment, and prior exposure to risk explain risk perception. We find significant values for the CRS-creditable mitigation activities, which provides empirical evidence for the benefits associated with the program. The marginal WTP for an additional credit point earned for public information activities, including hazard disclosure, is found to be the highest. Results also suggest that water amenities dominate flood risk. Thus, high amenity values may increase exposure to flood risk, and flood mitigation projects should be strategized in coastal regions accordingly.

N2  - Variation in terrestrial mammalian skull morphology is known to constrain feeding performance, which in turn influences dietary habits and ultimately fitness. Among mustelids, otters have evolved two feeding specializations: underwater raptorial capture of prey (mouth-oriented) and capture of prey by hand (hand-oriented), both of which have likely associations with morphology and bite performance. However, feeding biomechanics and performance data for otters are sparse. The first goal of this study was to investigate the relationships between feeding morphology and bite performance among two mouth-oriented piscivores (Pteronura brasiliensis and Lontra canadensis) and two hand-oriented invertebrate specialists (Enhydra lutris and Aonyx cinerea). Since other vertebrate taxa that are mouth-oriented piscivores tend to possess longer skulls and mandibles, with jaws designed for increased velocity at the expense of biting capability, we hypothesized that mouth-oriented otters would also possess long, narrow skulls indicative of high velocity jaws. Conversely, hand-oriented otters were expected to possess short, blunt skulls with adaptations to increase bite force and crushing capability. Concomitant with these skull shapes we hypothesized that sea otters would possess a greater mandibular bluntness index, providing for a greater mechanical advantage compared to other otter species investigated. A second goal was to examine morphological variation at a finer scale by assessing variation in cranial morphology among three sea otter subspecies. Since diet varies among these subspecies, and their populations are isolated, we hypothesized that the magnitude of mandibular bluntness and concomitant mechanical advantage, as well as occlusal surface area would also vary within species according to their primary food source (fish versus hard invertebrates). Functional expectations were met for comparisons among and within species. Among species the phylogeny suggests a deeply rooted transition to alternative foraging types. Yet within foraging types alternative species were also strongly variable, suggesting either selective differences in the extent or nature of realized foraging mode, or an accumulation of non-adaptive changes during the long independent evolutionary history. At the finest scale, variation among subspecies indicates that trophic adaptation occurred rapidly, making it interesting that we happened to find both deeply and shallowly-rooted transformations associated with diet type in otter species and subspecies.

N2  - The Christmas tree hydroid Pennaria disticha is listed as one of the most common introduced species in Hawaii. Firstly reported in Kaneohe Bay (Oahu) in 1928, it is now established throughout the entire archipelago, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a U.S. National Monument and World Heritage site. The Hawaiian population of P. disticha has also been reported as being the source of further introductions to Palmyra Atoll in the U.S. Line Islands. Using a phylogenetic hypothesis based on a 611 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial 16S barcoding gene, we demonstrate that P. disticha is a complex of cryptic species, rather than one species with cosmopolitan distribution. We also show that in Hawaii there are three species of Pennaria, rather than one introduced species. Two of these species share haplotypes with specimens from distant locations such as Florida and Panama and may have been introduced, possibly from the Atlantic Ocean. A third species could either represent a lineage with nearly cosmopolitan distribution, or another introduced species. Our dataset refutes the widely accepted idea that only one lineage of P. disticha is present in Hawaii. On the contrary, P. disticha in Hawaii may be the outcome of multiple independent introductions of several morphologically undistinguishable cryptic lineages. Our results uncover an unsuspected complexity within the very common hydroid P. disticha, and highlight the need for routine use of molecular tools, such as DNA barcoding, to improve the identification and recognition of non-indigenous species.

N2  - Testing phytoplankton viability within ballast tanks and receiving waters of ballast water discharge remain understudied. Potentially harmful dinoflagellates and diatoms are transported via ballast water to Galveston Bay, Texas (USA), home to three major ports: Houston, Texas City and Galveston. Ballast water from vessels transiting the North Atlantic Ocean was inoculated into treatments representing low and high salinity conditions similar to the Ports of Houston and Galveston respectively. Phytoplankton in ballast water growout experiments were deemed viable and showed growth in low and mid salinities with nutrient enrichment. Molecular methods identified several genera: Dinophysis, Gymnodinium, Gyrodinium, Heterocapsa, Peridinium, Scrippsiella, Chaetoceros and Nitzschia. These phytoplankton genera were previously identified in Galveston Bay except Scrippsiella. Phytoplankton, including those capable of forming harmful algal blooms leading to fish and shellfish kills, are transported to Galveston Bay via ballast water, and are viable when introduced to similar salinity conditions found in Galveston Bay ports.

N2  - The presence of a characteristic crustacean larval type, the nauplius, in many crustacean taxa has often been considered one of the few uniting characters of the Crustacea. Within Malacostraca, the largest crustacean group, nauplii are only present in two taxa, Euphauciacea (krill) and Decapoda Dendrobranchiata. The presence of nauplii in these two taxa has traditionally been considered a retained primitive characteristic, but free-living nauplii have also been suggested to have reappeared a couple of times from direct developing ancestors during malacostracan evolution. Based on a re-study of Thysanoessa raschii (Euphausiacea) using preserved material collected in Greenland, we readdress this important controversy in crustacean evolution, and, in the process, redescribe the naupliar and metanaupliar development of T. raschii. In contrast to most previous studies of euphausiid development, we recognize three (not two) naupliar (= ortho-naupliar) stages (N1-N3) followed by a metanauplius (MN). While there are many morphological changes between nauplius 1 and 2 (e.g., appearance of long caudal setae), the changes between nauplius 2 and 3 are few but distinct. They involve the size of some caudal spines (largest in N3) and the setation of the antennal endopod (an extra seta in N3). A wider comparison between free-living nauplii of both Malacostraca and non-Malacostraca revealed similarities between nauplii in many taxa both at the general level (e.g., the gradual development and number of appendages) and at the more detailed level (e.g., unclear segmentation of naupliar appendages, caudal setation, presence of frontal filaments). We recognize these similarities as homologies and therefore suggest that free-living nauplii were part of the ancestral malacostracan type of development. The derived morphology (e.g., lack of feeding structures, no fully formed gut, high content of yolk) of both euphausiid and dendrobranchiate nauplii is evidently related to their non-feeding (lecithotrophic) status.

N2  - Global population genetic structure of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) is still poorly understood despite its relevance for the tuna fishery industry. Low levels of genetic differentiation among oceans speak in favour of the existence of a single panmictic population worldwide of this highly migratory fish. However, recent studies indicated genetic structuring at a much smaller geographic scales than previously considered, pointing out that YFT population genetic structure has not been properly assessed so far. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time, the utility of 2b-RAD genotyping technique for investigating population genetic diversity and differentiation in high gene-flow species. Running de novo pipeline in Stacks, a total of 6772 high-quality genome-wide SNPs were identified across Atlantic, Indian and Pacific population samples representing all major distribution areas. Preliminary analyses showed shallow but significant population structure among oceans (FST=0.0273; P-value<0.01). Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components endorsed the presence of genetically discrete yellowfin tuna populations among three oceanic pools. Although such evidence needs to be corroborated by increasing sample size, these results showed the efficiency of this genotyping technique in assessing genetic divergence in a marine fish with high dispersal potential.

N2  - In this study, the authors developed three new approaches and models for improvements related to manufacturing processes. The main focus was on planning in a digital environment before the actual manufacturing process is carried out. The first approach is digital manufacturing, which gives affords the opportunity for performing an entire manufacturing process in a virtual environment. In this way, engineers virtually define, plan, create, monitor, and control all production processes. The planning phase can be done simultaneously, while other manufacturing processes are already in place. In this way, processes can continue with no interruption. Various product lifecycle management tools have databases of various programs that are used for interfacing and communication with machinery, such as CNC machines and industrial robots. Ideally, after the manufacturing process has been verified in the digital environment, control data can be uploaded to numerically controlled machinery so that the production process can start. Two special models have been developed for more detailed insight into special types of manufacturing processes. The second approach represents a model for the unique type of production that takes into account all resources as the most important factor in the manufacturing processes. The main variables that were included in this model were the availability and the presence of all required manufacturing resources needed for every single manufacturing operation. The third approach represents a model for large-scale production that includes all significant parameters of a manufacturing process, as well as all required intermediate storage. The last two models were developed as parametric, and the users in the training process can easily make tests for different types of input data.

N2  - In order to assess how environmental factors are affecting the distribution and migration of radioiodine and plutonium that were emitted from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, we quantified iodine and (239,240)Pu concentration changes in soil samples with different land uses (urban, paddy, deciduous forest and coniferous forest), as well as iodine speciation in surface water and rainwater. Sampling locations were 53-63 km northwest of the FDNPP within a 75-km radius, in close proximity of each other. A ranking of the land uses by their surface soil (<4 cm) stable (127)I concentrations was coniferous forest > deciduous forest > urban > paddy, and (239,240)Pu concentrations ranked as deciduous forest > coniferous forest > paddy ≥ urban. Both were quite distinct from that of (134)Cs and (137)Cs: urban > coniferous forest > deciduous forest > paddy, indicating differences in their sources, deposition phases, and biogeochemical behavior in these soil systems. Although stable (127)I might not have fully equilibrated with Fukushima-derived (129)I, it likely still works as a proxy for the long-term fate of (129)I. Surficial soil (127)I content was well correlated to soil organic matter (SOM) content, regardless of land use type, suggesting that SOM might be an important factor affecting iodine biogeochemistry. Other soil chemical properties, such as Eh and pH, had strong correlations to soil (127)I content, but only within a given land use (e.g., within urban soils). Organic carbon (OC) concentrations and Eh were positively, and pH was negatively correlated to (127)I concentrations in surface water and rain samples. It is also noticeable that (127)I in the wet deposition was concentrated in both the deciduous and coniferous forest throughfall and stemfall water, respectively, comparing to the bulk rainwater. Further, both forest throughfall and stemflow water consisted exclusively of organo-iodine, suggesting all inorganic iodine in the original bulk deposition (∼ 28.6% of total iodine) have been completely converted to organo-iodine. Fukushima-derived (239,240)Pu was detectable at a distance ∼ 61 km away, NW of FDNPP. However, it is confined to the litter layer, even three years after the FDNPP accident-derived emissions. Plutonium-239,240 activities were significantly correlated with soil OC and nitrogen contents, indicating Pu may be associated with nitrogen-containing SOM, similar to what has been observed at other locations in the United States. Together, these finding suggest that natural organic matter (NOM) plays a key role in affecting the fate and transport of I and Pu and may warrant greater consideration for predicting long-term stewardship of contaminated areas and evaluating various remediation options in Japan.

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. The carbon sequestration potential in coastal soils is linked to aboveground and belowground plant productivity and biomass, which in turn, is directly and indirectly influenced by nutrient input. We evaluated the influence of long-term and near-term nutrient input on aboveground and belowground carbon accumulation in seagrass beds, using a nutrient enrichment (nitrogen and phosphorus) experiment embedded within a naturally occurring, long-term gradient of phosphorus availability within Florida Bay (USA). We measured organic carbon stocks in soils and above- and belowground seagrass biomass after 17 months of experimental nutrient addition. At the nutrient-limited sites, phosphorus addition increased the carbon stock in aboveground seagrass biomass by more than 300 %; belowground seagrass carbon stock increased by 50–100 %. Soil carbon content slightly decreased ( ∼  10 %) in response to phosphorus addition. There was a strong but non-linear relationship between soil carbon and Thalassia testudinum leaf nitrogen : phosphorus (N : P) or belowground seagrass carbon stock. When seagrass leaf N : P exceeded an approximate threshold of 75 : 1, or when belowground seagrass carbon stock was less than 100 g m−2, there was less than 3 % organic carbon in the sediment. Despite the marked difference in soil carbon between phosphorus-limited and phosphorus-replete areas of Florida Bay, all areas of the bay had relatively high soil carbon stocks near or above the global median of 1.8 % organic carbon. The relatively high carbon content in the soils indicates that seagrass beds have extremely high carbon storage potential, even in nutrient-limited areas with low biomass or productivity.

N2  - Most Atlantic hurricanes form in the Main Development Region between 9°N to 20°N along the northern edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Previous research has suggested that meridional shifts in the ITCZ position on geologic timescales can modulate hurricane activity, but continuous and long-term storm records are needed from multiple sites to assess this hypothesis. Here we present a 3000 year record of intense hurricane strikes in the northern Bahamas (Abaco Island) based on overwash deposits in a coastal sinkhole, which indicates that the ITCZ has likely helped modulate intense hurricane strikes on the western North Atlantic margin on millennial to centennial-scales. The new reconstruction closely matches a previous reconstruction from Puerto Rico, and documents a period of elevated intense hurricane activity on the western North Atlantic margin from 2500 to 1000 years ago when paleo precipitation proxies suggest that the ITCZ occupied a more northern position. Considering that anthropogenic warming is predicted to be focused in the northern hemisphere in the coming century, these results provide a prehistoric analog that an attendant northern ITCZ shift in the future may again return the western North Atlantic margin to an active hurricane interval.

N2  - Cetaceans exhibit vaginal folds, unusual protrusions of the vaginal wall into the vaginal lumen. Inconsistent terminology and a lack of anatomical landmarks in the literature have hindered comparative studies of the form and function of vaginal folds. Our objectives are to: (1) develop a standardized measurement protocol for the reproductive tracts of female cetaceans, (2) assess variation in morphometrics within the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), and (3) determine if vaginal muscle is skeletal, and therefore of somatic origin in this species. We selected 15 measurements to characterize female reproductive tracts and evaluated variability using fresh or frozen-thawed specimens from southeastern USA representing a range of sexual maturity states and reproductive states (n = 18 specimens). Presence of skeletal muscle and variation in the density of muscle banding were assessed using 90 histological samples (n = 5 specimens). Analyses of the gross morphological data revealed that the dolphins generally had one large vaginal fold that bisected the vaginal lumen. Vaginal morphology was similar for sexually mature and immature specimens and across reproductive states. The histological data revealed that the vaginal musculature consisted of smooth muscle, consistent with other mammals, leading us to conclude that vaginal contractions are likely under autonomic rather than somatic control. No differences were found in the density of smooth muscle banding among vaginal regions or sexual maturity states. Our systematic protocol lays the foundation for evaluating the function (e.g., sexual selection, natural selection) and evolution of vaginal folds.

In many areas of the world, human consumption and climate change threaten freshwater inflows to coastal ecosystems. In the San Antonio Bay System, USA (SABS), freshwater inflows are projected to decrease in the coming decades. Our 30-month sampling period of SABS captured a prolonged period of higher inflows and a prolonged period of lower inflow. Our observations offer insights as to how this system might respond to lower freshwater inflows in the future. Of most importance in our observations was a regional shift that occurred in maximum primary productivity from the middle and lower SABS towards the upper SABS. In addition, a warm-month succession of phytoplankton taxa in the upper SABS that occurred during the wet period did not occur during the dry period. We also observed spatiotemporal shifts in apparent nitrogen- and phosphorus-limitation, with both appearing to influence phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity. Changes to SABS phytoplankton such as these might deleteriously affect organisms of higher trophic levels with life stages that are regionally confined by other factors, such as depth, macrophyte presence, and existence of hard-bottomed substrate, which in this bay system includes both commercially important and endangered species.

N2  - It has been suggested that exposure to high temperature or hypoxia may confer tolerance to the other oxygen-limited stressor (i.e., 'cross-tolerance'). Thus, we investigated if chronic hypoxia-acclimation (>3 months at 40% air saturation) improved the steelhead trout's critical thermal maximum (CTMax), or affected key physiological variables that could impact upper thermal tolerance. Neither CTMax (24.7 vs. 25.3°C) itself, nor oxygen consumption ( [Formula: see text] ), haematocrit, blood haemoglobin concentration, or heart rate differed between hypoxia- and normoxia-acclimated trout when acutely warmed. However, the cardiac output (Q̇) of hypoxia-acclimated fish plateaued earlier compared to normoxia-acclimated fish due to an inability to maintain stroke volume (SV), and this resulted in a ~50% lower maximum Q̇. Despite this reduced maximum cardiac function, hypoxia-acclimated trout were able to consume more O2 per volume of blood pumped as evidenced by the equivalent [Formula: see text] . These results provide additional evidence that long-term hypoxia improves tissue oxygen utilization, and that this compensates for diminished cardiac pumping capacity. The limited SV in hypoxia-acclimated trout in vivo was not associated with changes in cardiac morphology or in vitro maximum SV, but the affinity and density of myocardial ß-adrenoreceptors were lower and higher, respectively, than in normoxia-acclimated fish. These data suggest that alterations in ventricular filling dynamics or myocardial contractility constrain cardiac function in hypoxia-acclimated fish at high temperatures. Our results do not support (1) 'cross-tolerance' between high temperature and hypoxia when hypoxia is chronic, or (2) that cardiac function is always the determinant of temperature-induced changes in fish [Formula: see text] , and thus thermal tolerance, as suggested by the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) theory.

N2  - Turritopsis fascicularis Fraser, 1943 was first described off Alligator Reef, Florida, USA, at a depth of 216 m. Presumably a deep-sea species, its validity has often been questioned due to the scarcity of available records. In this paper, T. fascicularis is re-described from some mature colonies from the upper slope of the Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, new pictures of the colony, polyps, and medusa buds, are provided. A ~600bp sequence of the large ribosomal subunit of the mitochondrial RNA (lsu-rRNA, 16S), also known as the Hydrozoan barcoding molecule, is used for the first time to confirm the validity of T. fascicularis as a species, and analyze its phylogenetic position within the genus Turritopsis.

N2  - A new species of Ctenodrilus is described based on morphology, anatomy and molecular (COI and 16S) data. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the newly described Hawaiian species is the sister taxon of the widely distributed C. serratus. Comparisons of K2P distances show distances of at least 10.9 % for 16S and 18.7 % for CO1. Morphology of C. serratus differs from C. pacificus sp. nov. in the shape, number and distribution of multidentate hooks along the body, extent in segments of anterior ventral cilia, and presence of stomach cilia. Ctenodrilus pacificus sp. nov. resembles C. parvulus in terms of the internal anatomy but differs in respect to the shape of multidentate hooks. Asexual reproduction in the new species is described including associated changes in the external morphology and internal anatomy. A revision of the taxonomic characters of Ctenodrilus is also presented in order to provide background information for a better assessment of the widely distributed taxon Ctenodrilus serratus.

N2  - Wetlands attenuate the migration of many contaminants through a wide range of biogeochemical reactions. Recent research has shown that the rhizosphere, the zone near plant roots, in wetlands is especially effective at promoting contaminant attenuation. The objective of this study was to compare the soil organic matter (OM) composition and microbial communities of a rhizosphere soil (primarily an oxidized environment) to that of the bulk wetland soil (primarily a reduced environment). The rhizosphere had elevated C, N, Mn, and Fe concentrations and total bacteria, including Anaeromyxobacter, counts (as identified by qPCR). Furthermore, the rhizosphere contained several organic molecules that were not identified in the nonrhizosphere soil (54% of the >2200 ESI-FTICR-MS identified compounds). The rhizosphere OM molecules generally had (1) greater overall molecular weights, (2) less aromaticity, (3) more carboxylate and N-containing COO functional groups, and (4) a greater hydrophilic character. These latter two OM properties typically promote metal binding. This study showed for the first time that not only the amount but also the molecular characteristics of OM in the rhizosphere may in part be responsible for the enhanced immobilization of contaminants in wetlands. These finding have implications on the stewardship and long-term management of contaminated wetlands.

N2  - Using bacterial and fungal tag-encoded FLX-Titanium amplicon pyrosequencing, the microbiota of the faecal material of two blue whales living in the wild off the coast of California was investigated. In both samples the most predominant bacterial phylum was the Firmicutes with Clostridium spp. being the most dominant bacteria. The most predominant fungi were members of the phylum Ascomycota with Metschnikowia spp. being the most dominant. In this study, we also preliminarily characterised the culturable anaerobic bacteria from the faecal material, using traditional culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing approaches. In total, three bacterial species belonging to the phylum Firmicutes were identified.

Albacore (Thunnus alalunga) in the North Atlantic Ocean is currently managed as a single well-mixed stock, although this assumption remains contentious. We measured stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) and trace elements (Mg, Mn, Sr, Ba) in otoliths of albacore collected from two feeding grounds, namely the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic offshore waters, and compared them among sampling locations and life history stages. Measurements in otolith core, post-core and edge were used to determine whether albacore from these two regions have the same nursery origin and migratory patterns. We found no clear evidence of distinct nursery grounds based on otolith core chemistry, but Sr:Ca and Mg:Ca were different in the post-core portions of albacore from the two locations, suggesting residency in different regions during the early juvenile stage. Otolith edge chemistry, particularly stable isotopes and Sr:Ca, proved to be a valuable tool for classifying individuals to their capture locations. Annual cycles of Sr:Ca ratios were visible along life history transects, likely reflecting migratory patterns between water masses of differing salinity, but the timing of Sr:Ca cycles differed between the two groups. Differentiation in trace element concentrations in the otolith post-core and the timing of Sr:Ca cycles suggest the occurrence of two migratory contingents of albacore in the north-east Atlantic Ocean.

N2  - Comparisons of current and historic ocean ambient noise levels are rare, especially in the North Atlantic. Recent (2013-2014) monthly patterns in ocean ambient sound south of Bermuda were compared to those recorded at the same location in 1966. Additionally, trends in ocean traffic, in particular, Panama Canal traffic, over this time were also investigated. One year of ocean ambient noise measurements were collected in 1966 using cabled, omnidirectional hydrophones at the U.S. Navy Tudor Hill Laboratory in Bermuda, and repeat measurements were collected at the same location from June 2013-May 2014 using a High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package. Average monthly pressure spectrum levels at 44 Hz increased 2.8 ± 0.8 dB from 1966 to 2013, indicating an average increase of 0.6 dB/decade. This low level of increase may be due to topographic shielding at this site, limiting it to only southern exposure, and the limit in the number of ship transits through the Panama Canal, which did not change substantially during this time. The impending expansion of the Canal, which will enable the transit of larger ships at twice the current rate, is likely to lead to a substantial increase in ocean ambient sound at this location in the near future.

N2  - Otolith chemistry of juvenile and adult individuals of the Brazilian snapper Lutjanus alexandrei was measured to assess the utility of natural markers for investigating individual movements. Individuals were collected over a 3-year period (2010-2012) along the north-eastern coast of Brazil from both estuarine (juvenile to sub-adult stages) and coastal (sub-adult to adult stages) areas. Six elements ((7) Li, (24) Mg, (55) Mn, (59) Co, (88) Sr and (137) Ba) were measured in sectioned otoliths of L. alexandrei using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). Edge composition analysis indicated that element:Ca ratios in the otoliths of juvenile and sub-adult L. alexandrei from estuaries were not significantly different among the three consecutive years (2010, 2011 and 2012), suggesting that physicochemical conditions within the nursery area investigated were temporally stable. Similarly, apart from two elements (Ba and Co), element:Ca ratios for larger L. alexandrei inhabiting coastal waters were also similar. In contrast, otolith chemistry of similar sized L. alexandrei from estuarine and coastal areas was significantly different (based on recently accreted material). Otolith Mn:Ca and Ba:Ca were both significantly higher for L. alexandrei collected in estuaries compared to fish from adjacent coastal reefs, while the opposite trend was observed for Sr:Ca. Given the pronounced differences in otolith chemistry between estuarine and coastal areas, element:Ca transects were constructed from the core to margin of the otoliths for adults (age 7+ years) collected on reefs to determine the timing of movement (ontogenetic migration) from estuarine to coastal areas. Based on observed patterns of decline for both Mn:Ca and Ba:Ca, it appears that L. alexandrei begin the move to more coastal habitats (i.e. lower element:Ca ratios) after age 2 years. The patterns observed for this species highlight the importance of conserving connectivity between coastal habitats to maintain sustainable fish stocks exploited by artisanal fisheries.

N2  - Bearded seals possess a broad muscular snout with large mystacial vibrissal fields that are involved in tactile sensation and prey identification. Although the microstructure of bearded seal vibrissae and their feeding performance have been investigated their orofacial morphology has not. Such morphological studies are important to understand the underlying mechanisms of feeding performance and to test proposed functional hypotheses. Therefore, the facial musculature was examined in bearded seals to test functional hypotheses regarding feeding performance. The orofacial musculature is composed primarily of three enlarged muscular layers, the M. levator nasolabialis, M. orbicularis oris, and M. buccinatorius (superficial), M. maxillonasolabialis (intermediate), and the M. lateralis nasi and M. dilator nasi (deep). The expansion of these muscles, the three dimensionality of the entire muscular array, the soft tissue insertions, and constant volume fit the model of a muscular hydrostat, and explains the detailed and varied mobility of their snout. An anastomosing network of CN VII innervates these facial muscles. The disproportionately large infraorbital nerve of CN V courses toward the snout and divides into numerous branches that penetrate the external capsule of every Follicle Sinus-Complex. The anatomical evidence support that the M. orbicularis oris, M. buccinatorius, and M. maxillonasolabialis form a robust lateral lip complex that can occluded lateral gape during subambient pressure generation. The rostral portion of the M. orbicularis oris, M. dilator nasi, and M. mentalis function to pursue the rostral lips to form a circular aperture important for projecting steep pressure gradients rostral to the lips for prey acquisition.

N2  - This study presents findings on an oxytetracycline injected adult male shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus recaptured in waters off of southern California after 6 years at liberty. During the period at liberty, the vertebral band-pair deposition rate was validated at one per year. This result indicates that from a time at or near sexual maturity, male I. oxyrinchus in the north-east Pacific Ocean exhibit a band-pair deposition rate of one band pair per year, while deposition rates for juveniles in the area have been validated at two band pairs per year.

N2  - Most of the trace metal concentrations in ambient waters obtained a few decades ago have been considered unreliable owing to the lack of contamination control. Developments of some techniques aiming to reduce trace metal contamination in the last couple of decades have resulted in concentrations reported now being orders of magnitude lower than those in the past. These low concentrations often necessitate preconcentration of water samples prior to instrumental analysis of samples. Since contamination can appear in all phases of trace metal analyses, including sample collection (and during preparation of sampling containers), storage and handling, pretreatments, and instrumental analysis, specific care needs to be taken in order to reduce contamination levels at all steps. The effort to develop and utilize "clean techniques" in trace metal studies allows scientists to investigate trace metal distributions and chemical and biological behavior in greater details. This advancement also provides the required accuracy and precision of trace metal data allowing for environmental conditions to be related to trace metal concentrations in aquatic environments. This protocol that is presented here details needed materials for sample preparation, sample collection, sample pretreatment including preconcentration, and instrumental analysis. By reducing contamination throughout all phases mentioned above for trace metal analysis, much lower detection limits and thus accuracy can be achieved. The effectiveness of "clean techniques" is further demonstrated using low field blanks and good recoveries for standard reference material. The data quality that can be obtained thus enables the assessment of trace metal distributions and their relationships to environmental parameters.

               <jats:p>In this study, we modelled fishery observer data to compare methods of identifying community structure using cluster analyses to determine stratifications and probabilistic models for examining species co-occurrence in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater reef fish fishery. Comparing cluster analysis methods, the correlation measure of dissimilarity in combination with average agglomerative linkage was the most efficient method for determining species relationships using simulated random species as a comparison tool. Cluster analysis revealed distinct species stratifications and in combination with multiscale bootstrapping generated probabilities indicating the strength of stratifications in the fishery. A more parsimonious approach with probabilistic models was also developed to quantify pairwise species co-occurrence as random, positive, or negative based on the observed vs. expected fishing sets with co-occurrence. For the most common species captured, the probabilistic models predicted positive or negative co-occurrence between 84.2% of the pairwise combinations examined. These methods provide fishery managers tools for determining multispecies quota allocations and offer insights into other bycatch species of interest.</jats:p>

N2  - The marine fauna of the Southern Ocean is well known for an impressive adaptive radiation of fishes, the notothenioids. However, when compared to other marine areas, the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean also contain a seemingly large proportion of cryptic species. The documented instances of speciation in the absence of morphological change are largely observed in invertebrate taxa, in particular around peri- and sub-Antarctic islands such as South Georgia, which has been dubbed a cryptic species hotspot. This prevalence of cryptic species raises the question of how generalizable these patterns are for Antarctic vertebrates. Here we examine aspects of genotype and phenotype in an Antarctic notothenioid fish species, Lepidonotothen nudifrons, which is distributed in near shore habitats of the Antarctic Peninsula, South Orkney Islands, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands. The results of our analyses show that L. nudifrons comprises two species. We highlight that cryptic species are phenomena not restricted to invertebrate lineages, raising the possibility that the species diversity of notothenioids and other Southern Ocean fishes is under-described. In addition, our findings raise several questions about the evolutionary origin and maintenance of morphological stasis in one of the most extreme habitats on earth.

N2  - Recent studies have suggested myoglobin (Mb) may have other cellular functions in addition to storing and transporting O2. Indeed, NMR experiments have shown that the saturated fatty acid (FA) palmitate (PA) can interact with myoglobin (Mb) in its ligated state (MbCO and MbCN) but does not interact with Mb in its deoxygenated state. The observation has led to the hypothesis that Mb can also serve as a fatty acid transporter. The present study further investigates fatty acid interaction with the physiological states of Mb using the more soluble but unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid (OA). OA binds to MbCO but does not bind to deoxy Mb. OA binding to Mb, however, does not alter its O2 affinity. Without any Mb, muscle has a significantly lower level of triglyceride (TG). In Mb knock-out (MbKO) mice, both heart and skeletal muscles have lower level of TG relative to the control mice. Training further decreases the relative TG in the MbKO skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, the absence of Mb and lower TG level in muscle does not impair the MbKO mouse performance as evidenced by voluntary wheel running measurements. The results support the hypothesis of a complex physiological role for Mb, especially with respect to fatty acid metabolism.

N2  - The formation of the Isthmus of Panama stands as one of the greatest natural events of the Cenozoic, driving profound biotic transformations on land and in the oceans. Some recent studies suggest that the Isthmus formed many millions of years earlier than the widely recognized age of approximately 3 million years ago (Ma), a result that if true would revolutionize our understanding of environmental, ecological, and evolutionary change across the Americas. To bring clarity to the question of when the Isthmus of Panama formed, we provide an exhaustive review and reanalysis of geological, paleontological, and molecular records. These independent lines of evidence converge upon a cohesive narrative of gradually emerging land and constricting seaways, with formation of the Isthmus of Panama sensu stricto around 2.8 Ma. The evidence used to support an older isthmus is inconclusive, and we caution against the uncritical acceptance of an isthmus before the Pliocene.

N2  - A fundamental understanding of biodegradability is central to elucidating the role(s) of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) in biogeochemical cycles. Since microbial community and ecosystem dynamics are driven by net energy flows, then a quantitative assessment of energy value versus energy requirement for oxidation of PyOM should yield important insights into their biodegradability. We used bomb calorimetry, stepwise isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (isoTGA), and 5-year in situ bidegradation data to develop energy-biodegradability relationships for a suite of plant- and manure-derived PyOM (n = 10). The net energy value (ΔE) for PyOM was between 4.0 and 175 kJ mol(-1); with manure-derived PyOM having the highest ΔE. Thermal-oxidation activation energy (Ea) requirements ranged from 51 to 125 kJ mol(-1), with wood-derived PyOM having the highest Ea requirements. We propose a return-on-investment (ROI) parameter (ΔE/Ea) for differentiating short-to-medium term biodegradability of PyOM and deciphering if biodegradation will most likely proceed via cometabolism (ROI < 1) or direct metabolism (ROI ≥ 1). The ROI-biodegradability relationship was sigmoidal with higher biodegradability associated with PyOM of higher ROI; indicating that microbes exhibit a higher preference for "high investment value" PyOM.

N2  - Histological data from terrestrial, semiaquatic, and fully aquatic mammal vibrissa (whisker) studies indicate that follicle microstructure and innervation vary across the mystacial vibrissal array (i.e. medial microvibrissae to lateral macrovibrissae). However, comparative data are lacking, and current histological studies on pinniped vibrissae only focus on the largest ventrolateral vibrissae. Consequently, we investigated the microstructure, medial-to-lateral innervation, and morphometric trends in harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) vibrissal follicle-sinus complexes (F-SCs). The F-SCs were sectioned either longitudinally or in cross-section and stained with a modified Masson's trichrome stain (microstructure) or Bodian's silver stain (innervation). All F-SCs exhibited a tripartite blood organization system. The dermal capsule thickness, the distribution of major branches of the deep vibrissal nerve, and the hair shaft design were more symmetrical in medial F-SCs, but these features became more asymmetrical as the F-SCs became more lateral. Overall, the mean axon count was 1,221 ± 422.3 axons/F-SC and mean axon counts by column ranged from 550 ± 97.4 axons/F-SC (medially, column 11) to 1,632 ± 173.2 axons/F-SC (laterally, column 2). These values indicate a total of 117,216 axons innervating the entire mystacial vibrissal array. The mean axon count of lateral F-SCs was 1,533 ± 192.9 axons/ F-SC, which is similar to values reported in the literature for other pinniped F-SCs. Our data suggest that conventional studies that only examine the largest ventrolateral vibrissae may overestimate the total innervation by ∼20%. However, our study also accounts for variation in quantification methods and shows that conventional analyses likely only overestimate innervation by ∼10%. The relationship between axon count and cross-sectional F-SC surface area was nonlinear, and axon densities were consistent across the snout. Our data indicate that harp seals exhibit microstructural and innervational differences between their microvibrissae (columns 8-11) and macrovibrissae (columns 1-7). We hypothesize that this feature is conserved among pinnipeds and may result in functional compartmentalization within their mystacial vibrissal arrays.

N2  - The most conventional and abundant tracers of biomass combustion in aerosol particles include potassium and biomarkers derived from thermally altered cellulose/hemicellulose (anhydrosugars) and lignin (methoxyphenols). However, little is known of the role biomass combustion plays as a particulate source of major plant polymers to the atmosphere. Here, concentrations of solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and methoxyphenols are compared to the yields of polymeric lignin oxidation products (LOPs) during a smoke plume event in Houston, Texas. Downwind aerosol samples (PM2.5) were collected surrounding a two-day wildfire in the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge, 125 km southeast of Houston, which was 12-16 h directly downwind during the peak of the burn. Concentrations of all organic markers, potassium, and calcium increased by a factor of 2-13 within 1-2 days of the start of the fire and dropped to prefire levels 3 days after the peak event. Source signatures of anhydrosugars and methoxyphenols during the peak of the plume were identical to those of grass charcoals collected from the site, confirming the use of charcoals as end-members for source input reconstruction during atmospheric transport. An enrichment factor of 20 in the anhydrosugar to methoxyphenol ratio of aerosols versus charcoals can be explained partially by differences in degradation rate constants between the biomarker groups. LOPs comprised 73-91% of all lignin material in the aerosols, pointing to fires as major sources of primary biogenic aerosol particles in which lignin phenols occur predominantly in polymeric form.

N2  - Individual households have increasingly borne responsibility for reducing the adverse impacts of flooding on their property. Little observational research has been conducted, however, at the household level to examine the major factors contributing to the selection of a particular household adjustment. This study addresses the issue by evaluating statistically the factors influencing the adoption of various household flood hazard adjustments. The results indicate that respondents with higher-value homes or longer housing tenure are more likely to adopt structural and expensive techniques. In addition, the information source and the Community Rating System (CRS) score for the jurisdiction where the household is located have a significant bearing on household adjustment. In contrast, proximity to risk zones and risk perception yield somewhat mixed results or behave counter to assumptions in the literature. The study findings provide insights that will be of value to governments and decision-makers interested in encouraging homeowners to take protective action given increasing flood risk.

The blue shark (Prionace glauca) is subjected to high levels of fishery catch and by-catch worldwide; thus, knowledge of their productivity and population status is vital, yet basic assumptions of band-pair deposition rates in vertebrae used for age and growth models are being made without direct validation studies in the Pacific Ocean. As such, the purpose of the present study was to validate vertebral band-deposition rates of blue sharks tagged and recaptured in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Vertebrae of 26 blue sharks marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) were obtained from tag–recapture activities to determine timing of centrum growth-band deposition. Results from band counts distal to the OTC mark on each vertebra indicated that a single band pair (1 translucent and 1 opaque) is formed per year for blue sharks ranging from 1 to 8 years of age. Length–frequency modal analysis was also used to obtain growth estimates from a dataset spanning 26 years of research and commercial catch data. Results provide support for annual band-pair deposition in blue shark vertebrae and will aid in future blue shark age and growth studies in the Pacific Ocean.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Flatfish cranial asymmetry represents one of the most remarkable morphological innovations among vertebrates, and has fueled vigorous debate on the manner and rate at which strikingly divergent phenotypes evolve. A surprising result of many recent molecular phylogenetic studies is the lack of support for flatfish monophyly, where increasingly larger DNA datasets of up to 23 loci have either yielded a weakly supported flatfish clade or indicated the group is polyphyletic. Lack of resolution for flatfish relationships has been attributed to analytical limitations for dealing with processes such as nucleotide non-stationarity and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). We tackle this phylogenetic problem using a sequence dataset comprising more than 1,000 ultraconserved DNA element (UCE) loci covering 45 carangimorphs, the broader clade containing flatfishes and several other specialized lineages such as remoras, billfishes, and archerfishes. RESULTS: We present a phylogeny based on UCE loci that unequivocally supports flatfish monophyly and a single origin of asymmetry. We document similar levels of discordance among UCE loci as in previous, smaller molecular datasets. However, relationships among flatfishes and carangimorphs recovered from multilocus concatenated and species tree analyses of our data are robust to the analytical framework applied and size of data matrix used. By integrating the UCE data with a rich fossil record, we find that the most distinctive carangimorph bodyplans arose rapidly during the Paleogene (66.0-23.03 Ma). Flatfish asymmetry, for example, likely evolved over an interval of no more than 2.97 million years. CONCLUSIONS: The longstanding uncertainty in phylogenetic hypotheses for flatfishes and their carangimorph relatives highlights the limitations of smaller molecular datasets when applied to successive, rapid divergences. Here, we recovered significant support for flatfish monophyly and relationships among carangimorphs through analysis of over 1,000 UCE loci. The resulting time-calibrated phylogeny points to phenotypic divergence early within carangimorph history that broadly matches with the predictions of adaptive models of lineage diversification.

N2  - <jats:p> Effects of film thickness and electrolyte concentration on the photovoltaic performance of TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) were studied. Nanocrystalline anatase TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> thin films with varying thicknesses (3.2–18.9[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m) have been deposited on FTO/glass substrates by screen printing method as work electrodes for DSSC. The prepared samples were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy/Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (AFM/STM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimal thickness of the TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> photoanode is 13.5[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m. Short-circuit photocurrent density ([Formula: see text]) increases with film thickness due to enlargement of surface area whereas open-circuit voltage decreases with increase in thickness due to increase in electron diffusion length to the electrode. However, the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] of DSSC with a film thickness of 18.9[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m (7.5[Formula: see text]mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 0.687[Formula: see text]V) are smaller than those of DSSC with a TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> film thickness of 13.5[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m (9.9[Formula: see text]mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 0.734[Formula: see text]V). This is because the increased thickness of TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> thin film resulted in the decrease in the transmittance of TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> thin films hence reducing the incident light intensity on the N719 dye. Photovoltaic performance also depends greatly on the redox couple concentration in iodide[Formula: see text]triiodide. [Formula: see text] decreases as the redox concentration increases as a result of increased viscosity of the solution which lowers ion mobility. Similarly, [Formula: see text] decreases as the electrolyte concentration increases due to enhanced back electron transfer reaction. An optimum power conversion efficiency of 4.3% was obtained in a DSSC with the TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> film thickness of 13.5[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m and redox concentration of 0.03[Formula: see text]mol dm[Formula: see text] under AM 1.5G illumination at 100[Formula: see text]mW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. </jats:p>

N2  - Turritopsis dohrnii (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa, Hydroidolina, Anthoathecata) is the only known metazoan that is capable of reversing its life cycle via morph rejuvenation from the adult medusa stage to the juvenile polyp stage. Here, we present a complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence of T. dohrnii, which harbors genes for 13 proteins, two transfer RNAs, and two ribosomal RNAs. The T. dohrnii mt genome is characterized by typical features of species in the Hydroidolina subclass, such as a high A+T content (71.5%), reversed transcriptional orientation for the large rRNA subunit gene, and paucity of CGN codons. An incomplete complementary duplicate of the cox1 gene was found at the 5' end of the T. dohrnii mt chromosome, as were variable repeat regions flanking the chromosome. We identified species-specific variations (nad5, nad6, cob, and cox1 genes) and putative selective constraints (atp8, nad1, nad2, and nad5 genes) in the mt genes of T. dohrnii, and predicted alterations in tertiary structures of respiratory chain proteins (NADH4, NADH5, and COX1 proteins) of T. dohrnii. Based on comparative analyses of available hydrozoan mt genomes, we also determined the taxonomic relationships of T. dohrnii, recovering Filifera IV as a paraphyletic taxon, and assessed intraspecific diversity of various Hydrozoa species.

We measured PCDD/F concentrations in sediments and evaluated the potential for enhanced in situ biodegradation by surveying for Dehalococcoides mccartyi, an obligate organohalide respiring bacterium. Dehalococcoides spp. (98 % similar to D. mccartyi) and 22 other members of the class Dehalococcoidia were predominant 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) phylotypes. Dehalococcoides spp. were also present in the active fraction of the bacterial community. Presence/absence PCR screening detected D. mccartyi in sediment cores and sediment grab samples having at least 1 ng/kg dry wt. TEQ at salinities ranging from 0.6 to 19.5 PSU, indicating that they are widespread in the estuarine environment. Organic carbon-only and organic carbon + sulfate-amended sediment microcosm experiments resulted in ∼60 % reduction of ambient 2,3,7,8-TCDD in just 24 months leading to reductions in total TEQs by 38.4 and 45.0 %, respectively, indicating that 2,3,7,8-TCDD degradation is occurring at appreciable rates.

N2  - Assigning relative importance of spawning and nursery habitats for threatened and endangered teleosts, such as those seen in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), relies on the proper identification of the early life-history stages of the species of concern. Here, sequencing a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) I as barcodes is recommended to identify istiophorid (billfish) larvae in the Atlantic Ocean because of its high resolution and the intrinsic value of the levels of genetic variation that can be extracted from these data. The universality of the primers employed here demonstrates their utility for not only the positive identification of istiophorids in the GoM, but for any larval teleost occurring in areas recognized as larval hotspots worldwide.

N2  - Dense aggregations of foundation species often mitigate environmental stresses for organisms living among them. Considerable work documents such benefits by comparing conditions inside versus outside these biogenic habitats. However, environmental gradients commonly arise across the extent of even single patches of habitat-forming species, including cases where stresses diverge between habitat interiors and edges. We ask here whether such edge effects could alter how habitat-forming species influence residents, potentially changing the strength or direction of interactions (i.e., from stress amelioration to exacerbation). We take as a model system the classic marine foundation species, Mytilus californianus, the California mussel. Results demonstrate that mussel beds both increase and decrease thermal stresses. Over a distance of 6 to 10 cm from the bed interior to its upper surface, peak temperatures climb from as much as 20 °C below to 5 °C above those of adjacent bedrock. This directional shift in temperature modification affects interactions with juvenile mussels, such that thermal stresses and associated mortality risk are higher at the bed surface, but substantially reduced deeper within the adult matrix. These findings provide a case example of how stress gradients generated across biogenic habitats can markedly alter ecological interactions even within a single habitat patch.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Correctly identifying organisms is key to most biological research, and is especially critical in areas of biodiversity and conservation. Yet it remains one of the greatest challenges when studying all but the few well-established model systems. The challenge is in part due to the fact that most species have yet to be described, vanishing taxonomic expertise and the relative inaccessibility of taxonomic information. Furthermore, identification keys and other taxonomic resources are based on complex, taxon-specific vocabularies used to describe important morphological characters. Using these resources is made difficult by the fact that taxonomic documentation of the world's biodiversity is an international endeavour, and keys and field guides are not always available in the practitioner's native language. NEW INFORMATION: To address this challenge, we have developed a publicly available on-line illustrated multilingual glossary and translation tool for technical taxonomic terms using the Symbiota Software Project biodiversity platform. Illustrations, photographs and translations have been sourced from the global community of taxonomists working with marine invertebrates and seaweeds. These can be used as single-language illustrated glossaries or to make customized translation tables. The glossary has been launched with terms and illustrations of seaweeds, tunicates, sponges, hydrozoans, sea anemones, and nemerteans, and already includes translations into seven languages for some groups. Additional translations and development of terms for more taxa are underway, but the ultimate utility of this tool depends on active participation of the international taxonomic community.

N2  - <jats:p>Two new species of anchialine cave shrimp from Cozumel Island are described. A new species from the family Agostocarididae,<jats:italic>Agostocaris zabaletai</jats:italic>n. sp., occurs in three cenotes on the island (Chempita, Chankanaab System and Tres Potrillos). This new species is closely related to<jats:italic>Agostocaris</jats:italic><jats:italic>bozanici</jats:italic>that is known from one isolated cenote in another zone of the island.<jats:italic>Agostocaris zabaletai</jats:italic>n. sp. is similar to<jats:italic>A. bozanici</jats:italic>because it lacks a rostrum with teeth, and the palp of the first maxilliped is not segmented. In addition<jats:italic>A. zabaletai</jats:italic>also differs from<jats:italic>A. bozanici</jats:italic>by bearing four pairs of spines on the telson and only one spine on the outer ramus of the uropods. Both<jats:italic>Agostocaris williamsi</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Agostocaris acklinsensis</jats:italic>differ from<jats:italic>A. zabaletai</jats:italic>because both species have occasionally a serrate rostrum, and these species are reported exclusively from the Bahamas. A new family, Anchialocarididae, new genus and species<jats:italic>Anchialocaris paulini</jats:italic>n. sp. are described. This new species is known exclusively from the cenote Chempita located in the central area of the island. The new family Anchialocarididae is closely related to the families Agostocarididae and Atyidae because they have a similar branchial formulae. The main difference is that the new family has a simple articulation between carpus and palm of the first pereiopod, and this appendage is more slender than the second. Although the new family has several setae on the rudimentary propodus on the second pereiopod it lacks the abundance of setae found in other members of the Atyidae family genus<jats:italic>Typhlatya</jats:italic>. The relationship between this new family and the Agostocarididae is discussed.</jats:p>

N2  - This paper examines household adjustments to Hurricane Katrina by estimating the effects of Katrina-induced damages on changes in household demographics and income distributions in the Orleans Parish between 2000 and 2012. Adjustment patterns are found to be heterogeneous across ethno-racial segments, income classes, and educational attainment. Shares of middle-income and affluent households along with educated individuals decreased in severely damaged areas relative to less damaged ones. Also the share of individuals with lower educational levels and incomes below the poverty line increased in severely damaged block groups. Furthermore, the share of the white population decreased and the share of the black population increased in damaged areas for both home owners and renters. Overall adjustment patterns suggest that resource and financially constrained population adjust by moving into previously damaged areas, while economically capable households adjust by relocating to safer areas within or outside of the parish. Given estimated increases in vulnerable segments of the population in hazardous hotspots, public efforts should focus on either revitalizing poorer neighborhoods, by investing in long-term hazard mitigation measures and improving infrastructure, with segregated housing or assisting gradual population retreat to enhance community resilience and reduce vulnerability and exposure to future catastrophic events.

N2  - Storm surge protection systems have proven effective in protecting populations in developed areas and can allow for development in otherwise potentially flood-prone areas. Resultant intensification of land conversion can result in large scale habitat fragmentation. Simultaneously, urbanized areas worldwide are increasingly accumulating large amounts of vacant land, creating an unprecedented opportunity to improve green space networks and natural systems. This article describes creation of a regional growth framework that balances the need to repurpose vacant lots with the provision of ecosystem services. The analysis seeks to maximize the structural connectivity of the landscape by using high ecological potential of vacant lands as a device for linking existing habitat patches, wildlife conservation areas, wetlands, riparian corridors, and small-scale green spaces. The research uses raster-based suitability models generated in ArcGIS to determine development potential and ecological values of vacant land parcels. Vacant lands having low development potential and high ecological value are linked spatially to create ecological corridors among patch areas using a least cost path connectivity model generated with Linkage Mapper software. Results indicate that vacant land can connect existing ecological patch and core areas with relatively minimal negative impact on development potential while simultaneously enhancing provision of ecological services. The approach provides a model for an ecological based solution to repurposing vacant urban land.

N2  - Historically, wetlands in the United States have been lost due to agriculture, anthropogenic activities, and rapid urbanization along the coast. Such losses of wetlands have resulted in high flooding risk for coastal communities over the period of time. In addition, alteration of wetlands via the Section 404 Clean Water Act permits can increase the flooding risk to future hurricane events, as the cumulative impact of this program is poorly understood and under-accounted. Further, recovery after hurricane events is acting as an encouragement for new development and reconstruction activities by converting wetlands under the wetland alteration permitting program. This study investigates the degree to which hurricane recovery activities in coastal communities are undermining the ability of these places to absorb the impacts of future storm events. Specifically, this work explores how and to what extent wetlands are being affected by the federal permitting program post-Hurricane Ike in 2008. Wetland alteration patterns are examined across three counties (Harris, Galveston, and Chambers County) along the Texas Gulf Coast over a 10-year time period, from 2004-2013 (five years before and after Hurricane Ike) by conducting descriptive spatial analyses. Results indicate that after Hurricane Ike, the number of permits substantially increased in Harris and Chambers County. The vast majority of individual and nationwide type permits were issued within the 100-year floodplain, storm surge zones, and areas damaged by Ike flooding, suggesting that recovery after the hurricane is compromising the ecological resiliency on which coastal communities depend. The authors expect that the findings of this study can increase awareness to policy makers and hazard mitigation planners regarding how to manage wetlands during a long-term recovery process to maintain their natural functions for future flood mitigation.

N2  - Land-locked anchialine blue holes are karstic sinkholes and caves with tidally influenced, vertically stratified water bodies that harbor endemic fauna exhibiting variable troglomorphic features. These habitats represent island-like systems, which can serve to elucidate evolutionary and biogeographic processes at local scales. We investigated whether the 'continuous spelean corridor' hypothesis may elucidate the biogeographical distributions of the stygobitic annelid Pelagomacellicephala iliffei (Polynoidae) collected from the Great Bahama and Caicos Banks of the Bahamas Archipelago. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using Bayesian Inference on individual and combined datasets of three molecular markers (16S rDNA, COI, 18S rDNA) and species delimitation employed three widely accepted methods in DNA taxonomy, namely GMYC, bPTP, and ABGD. Mantel tests were used to test the effect of geography on genetic structure. Using these analyses, we recovered five independently evolving entities of the focal species across four islands of the Great Bahama Bank including Cat, Eleuthera, Exumas, and Long. Genetic data yielded strong correlations between islands and phylogenetic entities, signifying independent evolutionary histories within anchialine caves across the platform. The island of Eleuthera showed intra-island gene flow and dispersal capabilities between blue holes separated by 115km, providing evidence of a crevicular spelean corridor within the island. However, no evidence of inter-island dispersal is present in the analyzed system. Consistent with previous biogeographic studies of cave crustaceans, the major barriers shaping the cave biota of the Bahamas Archipelago appears to be the deep trenches and channels separating the Bahamian banks.

N2  - Global changes are causing broad-scale shifts in vegetation communities worldwide, including coastal habitats where the borders between mangroves and salt marsh are in flux. Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored. Because different processes varied in different ways with mangrove cover, the "optimum" cover of mangroves from a societal point of view will depend on which ecosystem services are most desired.

N2  - Percomorph fishes represent over 17,100 species, including several model organisms and species of economic importance. Despite continuous advances in the resolution of the percomorph Tree of Life, resolution of the sister lineage to Percomorpha remains inconsistent but restricted to a small number of candidate lineages. Here we use an anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) dataset of 132 loci with over 99,000 base pairs to identify the sister lineage of percomorph fishes. Initial analyses of this dataset failed to recover a strongly supported sister clade to Percomorpha, however, scrutiny of the AHE dataset revealed a bias towards high GC content at fast-evolving codon partitions (GC bias). By combining several existing approaches aimed at mitigating the impacts of convergence in GC bias, including RY coding and analyses of amino acids, we consistently recovered a strongly supported clade comprised of Holocentridae (squirrelfishes), Berycidae (Alfonsinos), Melamphaidae (bigscale fishes), Cetomimidae (flabby whalefishes), and Rondeletiidae (redmouth whalefishes) as the sister lineage to Percomorpha. Additionally, implementing phylogenetic informativeness (PI) based metrics as a filtration method yielded this same topology, suggesting PI based approaches will preferentially filter these fast-evolving regions and act in a manner consistent with other phylogenetic approaches aimed at mitigating GC bias. Our results provide a new perspective on a key issue for studies investigating the evolutionary history of more than one quarter of all living species of vertebrates.

N2  - <jats:p>The bearded fireworm, <jats:italic>Hermodice carunculata,</jats:italic> is a common species in the marine annelid taxon Amphinomidae. It has a widespread distribution throughout the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, Mediterranean and Red Seas. We review its environmental tolerances, defence mechanisms and feeding habits to evaluate its potential to survive in changing ocean conditions, to increasingly emerge as a nuisance species and to invade new geographic areas. <jats:italic>Hermodice carunculata</jats:italic> tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions, including temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation and various types of pollution. It has few natural predators because it is protected by its sharp chaetae and probably by toxins. <jats:italic>Hermodice carunculata</jats:italic> is best known for consuming live cnidarians, and has been implicated in transmitting coral pathogens, but it also feeds non-selectively on detritus. In the short term, we predict that <jats:italic>H. carunculata</jats:italic> will be able to withstand many future ecological challenges and possibly contribute to coral reef decline. In the long term, ocean acidification may negatively impact its defence mechanisms and survival. Its invasive potential may be significant. We highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the reproduction and development of this species, the nature and origin of its toxins and role of microbes in their feeding behaviour and defensive strategies.</jats:p>

N2  - © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America. Global changes are causing broad-scale shifts in vegetation communities worldwide, including coastal habitats where the borders between mangroves and salt marsh are in flux. Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored. Because different processes varied in different ways with mangrove cover, the "optimum" cover of mangroves from a societal point of view will depend on which ecosystem services are most desired.

N2  - Among the key environmental factors influencing the fate and transport of radionuclides in the environment is natural organic matter (NOM). While this has been known for decades, there still remains great uncertainty in predicting NOM-radionuclide interactions because of lack of understanding of radionuclide interactions with the specific organic moieties within NOM. Furthermore, radionuclide-NOM studies conducted using modelled organic compounds or elevated radionuclide concentrations provide compromised information related to true environmental conditions. Thus, sensitive techniques are required not only for the detection of radionuclides, and their different species, at ambient and/or far-field concentrations, but also for potential trace organic compounds that are chemically binding these radionuclides. GC-MS and AMS techniques developed in our lab are reviewed here that aim to assess how two radionuclides, iodine and plutonium, form strong bonds with NOM by entirely different mechanisms; iodine tends to bind to aromatic functionalities, whereas plutonium binds to N-containing hydroxamate siderophores at ambient concentrations. While low-level measurements are a prerequisite for assessing iodine and plutonium migration at nuclear waste sites and as environmental tracers, it is necessary to determine their in-situ speciation, which ultimately controls their mobility and transport in natural environments. More importantly, advanced molecular-level instrumentation (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI-FTICRMS) were applied to resolve either directly or indirectly the molecular environments in which the radionuclides are associated with the NOM.

N2  - The interconnected topology of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) readily lends to mathematical (or in silico) representation and analysis as a stoichiometric matrix. Such a matrix can be 'solved' using the mathematical method of extreme pathway (ExPa) analysis, which identifies uniquely activated genes subject to transcription factor (TF) availability. In this manuscript, in silico multi-tissue TRN models of brain, liver and gonad were used to study reproductive endocrine developmental programming in zebrafish (Danio rerio) from 0.25h post fertilization (hpf; zygote) to 90 days post fertilization (dpf; adult life stage). First, properties of TRN models were studied by sequentially activating all genes in multi-tissue models. This analysis showed the brain to exhibit lowest proportion of co-regulated genes (19%) relative to liver (23%) and gonad (32%). This was surprising given that the brain comprised 75% and 25% more TFs than liver and gonad respectively. Such 'hierarchy' of co-regulatory capability (brain<liver<gonad) indicated presence of highly gene-specific TRNs in the brain, alluding to its role as 'master controller' of endocrine function. Second, TRN models were constrained with varying TF availabilities during zebrafish development. Normalized numbers of genes active during development showed concomitant activations between brain and gonad from 10 to 12 hpf (embryonic life stage) up to 30-90 dpf (adult life stage). This indicated a putative 'syncing' between the brain and gonad, and initiation of an early reproductive endocrine developmental program. Finally, comparison of in vivo active genes with those predicted in silico showed relatively good agreement for brain (49%), liver (27%) and gonad (32%). The multi-tissue TRN models presented can lend diagnostic insights into the effects of changing environmental and/or genetic constraints on reproductive endocrine function.

N2  - Food web structure is shaped by interactions within and across trophic levels. As such, understanding how the presence and absence of predators, prey, and competitors affect species foraging patterns is important for predicting the consequences of changes in species abundances, distributions, and behaviors. Here, we used plasma δ13C and δ15N values from juvenile blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and juvenile sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens) to investigate how species co-occurrence affects their trophic interactions in littoral waters of Moorea, French Polynesia. Co-occurrence led to isotopic niche partitioning among sharks within nurseries, with significant increases in δ15N values among sicklefin lemon sharks, and significant decreases in δ15N among blacktip reef sharks. Niche segregation likely promotes coexistence of these two predators during early years of growth and development, but data do not suggest coexistence affects life history traits, such as body size, body condition, and ontogenetic niche shifts. Plasticity in trophic niches among juvenile blacktip reef sharks and sicklefin lemon sharks also suggests these predators are able to account for changes in community structure, resource availability, and intra-guild competition, and may fill similar functional roles in the absence of the other species, which is important as environmental change and human impacts persist in coral reef ecosystems.

N2  - Complex foldings of the vaginal wall are unique to some cetaceans and artiodactyls and are of unknown function(s). The patterns of vaginal length and cumulative vaginal fold length were assessed in relation to body length and to each other in a phylogenetic context to derive insights into functionality. The reproductive tracts of 59 female cetaceans (20 species, 6 families) were dissected. Phylogenetically-controlled reduced major axis regressions were used to establish a scaling trend for the female genitalia of cetaceans. An unparalleled level of vaginal diversity within a mammalian order was found. Vaginal folds varied in number and size across species, and vaginal fold length was positively allometric with body length. Vaginal length was not a significant predictor of vaginal fold length. Functional hypotheses regarding the role of vaginal folds and the potential selection pressures that could lead to evolution of these structures are discussed. Vaginal folds may present physical barriers, which obscure the pathway of seawater and/or sperm travelling through the vagina. This study contributes broad insights to the evolution of reproductive morphology and aquatic adaptations and lays the foundation for future functional morphology analyses.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the steroidogenic effects of sertraline, a popular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on larval fathead minnow (FHM; Pimephales promelas) and adult FHM. Larvae were exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10 µg/L sertraline for 28 days and analyzed for differential mRNA expression of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20β-HSD), aromatase (CYP19a), nuclear thyroid receptor alpha (TRα), and normalized to RP-L8. Adult FHM were exposed to 3 or 10 µg/L sertraline for 7 days and analyzed for differential expression of the same genes with the addition of thyroid receptor beta (TRβ). Larval FHM exposed to 0.1 μg/L had a significant upregulation of both 20β-HSD and TRα while adult FHM exposed to 10 µg/L had a significant upregulation of 11β-HSD expression in brain tissue. The significance of these findings with respect to survival, growth and reproduction are currently unknown, but represent areas for future research.

N2  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>During the last three decades, technological innovations in cargo handling equipment have made it possible to automate operational processes in container terminals. Despite the increasing trend in terminal automation, little work has been done to develop theoretical guidelines for evaluating the benefits of this industrial practice. We assess terminal automation by focusing on whether <jats:italic>strategic content</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>process structure</jats:italic> are aligned. In this study, we explore the reasons that these results are mixed in the context of service automation. Have market competitiveness and operational performance been enhanced by automation in seaports? We focus on two key strategic elements and their proper alignment to produce the best performance for a port. The first element is the overall business strategy and strategic content adopted by the port. In this study, we look at Porter’s (Competitive strategy, Free Press, New York, 1980) generic strategic classification of low cost, differentiation, or focus strategies. The second element is the process structure of the port, which may have been impacted by technological innovation. Using the framework of contingency theory, we explore the interface of strategic content and process structure and how this interface impacts the service process automation. A multiple case study is conducted on a sample of 20 container terminals, selected from the list of 2014 Journal of Commerce’s Top Productive Terminals. We come up with three important findings. First, a port’s strategic market position determines the choice of overall business strategy. If a port is strategically positioned as an international gate, then it should adopt an overall cost-leadership strategy, whereas a transshipment terminal should adopt an overall differentiation strategy. Second, we find that the process structure adopted is associated with the level of automation, and a differentiation strategy is dependent on the level of flexibility, speed, and reliability. Higher market uncertainty requires higher flexibility, while lower market uncertainty requires greater speed and reliability. Third, the level of process automation depends on throughput volume and stability. Closer relationships with maritime supply–chain partners help increase throughput volume and reduce throughput uncertainty.</jats:p>

N2  - Sunlight can inhibit or disrupt the aggregation process of marine colloids via cleavage of high molecular weight compounds into smaller, less stable fragments. In contrast, some biomolecules, such as proteins excreted from bacteria can form aggregates via cross-linking due to photo-oxidation. To examine whether light-induced aggregation can occur in the marine environment, we conducted irradiation experiments on a well-characterized protein-containing exopolymeric substance (EPS) from the marine bacterium Sagitulla stellata. Our results show that after 1 h sunlight irradiation, the turbidity level of soluble EPS was 60% higher than in the dark control. Flow cytometry also confirmed that more particles of larger sized were formed by sunlight. In addition, we determined a higher mass of aggregates collected on filter in the irradiated samples. This suggests light can induce aggregation of this bacterial EPS. Reactive oxygen species hydroxyl radical and peroxide played critical roles in the photo-oxidation process, and salts assisted the aggregation process. The observation that Sagitulla stellata EPS with relatively high protein content promoted aggregation, was in contrast to the case where no significant differences were found in the aggregation of a non-protein containing phytoplankton EPS between the dark and light conditions. This, together with the evidence that protein-to-carbohydrate ratio of aggregates formed under light condition is significantly higher than that formed under dark condition suggest that proteins are likely the important component for aggregate formation. Light-induced aggregation provides new insights into polymer assembly, marine snow formation, and the fate/transport of organic carbon and nitrogen in the ocean.

N2  - Surveys of the anchialine crustacean fauna of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP), Mexico, have revealed the occurrence of calanoid copepods. The genus Stephos Scott, 1892, belonging to the family Stephidae is among the most frequent and widely distributed groups in anchialine caves but has not been hitherto recorded from the YP. Recent collections from an anchialine cave in an island off the northern coast of the YP yielded many specimens of a new species of Stephos. The new taxon, S. fernandoisp. n., is described here based on male and female specimens. The new species is clearly distinguished from its congeners by the following characters: male left fifth leg with three terminal lamellae plus subdistal process, right leg with distal row of peg-like elements; female fifth leg with single long, acute apical process; genital double-somite with two rows each of 4 long spinules adjacent to operculum; legs 2-4 with articulated setae. The diversity of the genus shows regional differences; the Australia-Western Pacific region is the most diverse (eleven species), followed by the Mediterranean (seven species) and the Northeastern Atlantic (six species); only four species are known from the Northwestern Tropical Atlantic (NWTA). The morphology of the female fifth leg was examined to explore possible biogeographic trends in the genus; patterns suggest multiple colonization events in the highly diverse regions and a relatively recent radiation in the NWTA, characterized by anchialine forms. The introduction of stephid copepods in the region may be a relatively recent event derived from colonization of benthopelagic ancestral forms and subsequent invasion onto cave habitats. The new species appears to be linked to the strictly anchialine Miostephos.

N2  - A new species of mud shrimp of the genus Naushonia Kingsley, 1897 is described from two anchialine caves on the island of Great Abaco in the Bahamas. Naushonia tinkeri n. sp. is the fifteenth species in the genus and the second to be described from the Bahamas. The new species is morphologically similar to N. augudrea (Juarrero & García, 1997) from Holguín Province, eastern Cuba, with which it shares a carapace with cervical and cardiac grooves; however, it can be distinguished by having a pigmented cornea, the first pereiopod with a proportionately longer propodus and dactylus without a toothed external margin, and the telson longer relative to the uropod length. The new species inhabits anchialine caves and is the largest one reported until now.

Environmental contextReleases to the aquatic environment from radiological dispersal devices, accidents or leaking waste disposal sites require close monitoring for radionuclide identification. A novel in situ gamma spectrometer deployable on platforms in coastal waters can provide detailed radioisotopic, however, only after the radionuclides are pre-concentrated on efficient sorbents. Here, we report results of particle–water distribution coefficients, KD, on three novel MnO2 sorbents using a set of artificial and natural radionuclides in small batch experiments.
AbstractAfter nuclear disasters, there is a need to monitor released radionuclides in aquatic systems. A novel in situ gamma spectrometer deployable on mobile and stationary platforms can detect individual radionuclides, provided concentrations are high enough. Owing to rapid dilution effects, efficient sorbents are needed for preconcentration of radionuclides. Here, we report results of particle–water distribution coefficients, KD, on three novel MnO2 sorbents mounted in high-capacity cartridges using a set of artificial (57Co, 106Ru, 125Sb, 133Ba, 137Cs) and natural (7Be, 210Pb, 233Pa, 234Th) radionuclides in small batch experiments. Compared with conventionally impregnated MnO2 sorbents, novel nanostructured MnO2 sorbents displayed superior sorption for some artificial radionuclides, displaying up to one order of magnitude greater KD values than traditionally impregnated MnO2. In particular, the log KD value of 210Pb was highest (4.48±0.23) compared with all values using the other MnO2 sorbents, whereas that of 233Pa was among the lowest (3.24±0.16). These results promise some improvements for capturing not only artificially produced radionuclides, but also naturally produced 7Be from seawater using nanostructured MnO2. We also show that colloidal forms of selected radionuclides are not captured by MnO2 phases. If they could be sorbed by another sorbent, KD values could be considerably higher for Th, Po and other radionuclides. Finally, our results might add further complexities to the discussion of the potential of Th/Pa fractionation by MnO2 phases in seawater.

N2  - Contaminated soil organic matter from the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) has been previously shown to accumulate plutonium (Pu) in a colloidal subfraction and is hypothesized to contain cutin-like chemical structures cross-linked with hydroxamate functionality. The present study further characterizes this high Pu affinity subfraction using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICRMS) and discovers additional substructural components. The Pu-enriched fraction was extracted and purified through a series of ultrafiltration and isoelectric focusing (IEF) electrophoresis steps. Predominantly low H/C and high double-bond equivalence (DBE) aromatic and condensed aromatic molecular formulas were detected, 66% of which are included in a COO Kendrick mass defect (KMD) homologous series. This suggests the existence of polycarboxylated aromatic and condensed aromatic formulas, with CHON-type COO KMD formulas relatively more abundant in the purified subfraction where Pu had been observed than in the crude soil fractions which had successively lower Pu concentrations. Nitrogen contents increased with the progression of purification (bulk soil → crude colloid → IEF colloid) and coincided with the trend of Pu concentration; thus, we propose that these nitrogen and carboxyl functionalities of aromatic compounds may also impart significant Pu chelation character to the colloid.

N2  - <jats:p>A new species belonging to the crustacean class Remipedia is described from an anchialine cave system on the island of Cozumel (Mexico), and is illustrated and compared morphologically and molecularly (CO1 and 16S) with closely related taxa. Xibalbanus cozumelensis sp. nov., the first remipede described from Cozumel, is morphologically similar to Xibalbanus tulumensis (Yager, 1987) from the Yucatán Peninsula, but the two species are genetically separate from each other (about 10% in CO1). A phylogenetic (Bayesian) analysis of Yucatán remipede populations based on CO1 and 16S placed them in a monophyletic Xibalbanus (in Xibalbanidae fam. nov.), with X. cozumelensis as most closely related to X. tulumensis. The Yucatán Peninsula and Cozumel have been separate since approx. early Cenozoic (~65 Ma), which suggests allopatric speciation for X. cozumelensis sp. nov. and X. tulumensis. However, the comparatively low genetic divergence between the two species may indicate that there has been gene flow between ‘mainland’ Yucatán and Cozumel long after the geological separation of the two landmasses, e.g., in cave systems under the sea bed, either continuously or sporadically, for example during the Last Glacial Maximum when the sea level was about 120 m lower than today.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p> Audiences that view sea level rise as a distant hazard or hold doubtful or dismissive beliefs about climate change in general may not be receptive to information about this hazard. This study explores how maps may address these challenges to sea level rise communication by making visible the impacts of sea level rise on local communities. Using an interactive map of sea level rise in Sarasota, Florida and an accompanying online survey, it considers how college students from nearby and far away from Sarasota, and with different views about climate change, vary in their risk perceptions. Results show that, consistent with spatial optimism bias, risk perceptions increased more from pre- to post map for respondents far away from Sarasota than for those nearby, while respondents who were initially doubtful or cautious about climate change showed larger increases in risk perceptions than those who were disengaged or alarmed. </jats:p>

N2  - The evolution of filter feeding in baleen whales (Mysticeti) facilitated a wide range of ecological diversity and extreme gigantism. The innovation of filter feeding evolved in a shift from a mineralized upper and lower dentition in stem mysticetes to keratinous baleen plates that hang only from the roof of the mouth in extant species, which are all edentulous as adults. While all extant mysticetes are born with a mandible lacking a specialized feeding structure (i.e., baleen), the bony surface retains small foramina with elongated sulci that often merge together in what has been termed the alveolar gutter. Because mysticete embryos develop tooth buds that resorb in utero, these foramina have been interpreted as homologous to tooth alveoli in other mammals. Here, we test this homology by creating 3D models of the internal mandibular morphology from terrestrial artiodactyls and fossil and extant cetaceans, including stem cetaceans, odontocetes and mysticetes. We demonstrate that dorsal foramina on the mandible communicate with the mandibular canal via smaller canals, which we explain within the context of known mechanical models of bone resorption. We suggest that these dorsal foramina represent distinct branches of the inferior alveolar nerve (or artery), rather than alveoli homologous with those of other mammals. As a functional explanation, we propose that these branches provide sensation to the dorsal margin of the mandible to facilitate placement and occlusion of the baleen plates during filer feeding.

N2  - Cave shrimps from the genera Typhlatya, Stygiocaris and Typhlopatsa (Atyidae) are restricted to specialised coastal subterranean habitats or nearby freshwaters and have a highly disconnected distribution (Eastern Pacific, Caribbean, Atlantic, Mediterranean, Madagascar, Australia). The combination of a wide distribution and a limited dispersal potential suggests a large-scale process has generated this geographic pattern. Tectonic plates that fragment ancestral ranges (vicariance) has often been assumed to cause this process, with the biota as passive passengers on continental blocks. The ancestors of these cave shrimps are believed to have inhabited the ancient Tethys Sea, with three particular geological events hypothesised to have led to their isolation and divergence; (1) the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, (2) the breakup of Gondwana, and (3) the closure of the Tethys Seaway. We test the relative contribution of vicariance and dispersal in the evolutionary history of this group using mitochondrial genomes to reconstruct phylogenetic and biogeographic scenarios with fossil-based calibrations. Given that the Australia/Madagascar shrimp divergence postdates the Gondwanan breakup, our results suggest both vicariance (the Atlantic opening) and dispersal. The Tethys closure appears not to have been influential, however we hypothesise that changing marine currents had an important early influence on their biogeography.

N2  - Effects of film thickness and electrolyte concentration on the photovoltaic performance of TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) were studied. Nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 thin films with varying thicknesses (3.2&#x2013;18.9&#x3BC;m) have been deposited on FTO/glass substrates by screen printing method as work electrodes for DSSC. The prepared samples were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy/Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (AFM/STM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimal thickness of the TiO2 photoanode is 13.5&#x3BC;m. Short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) increases with film thickness due to enlargement of surface area whereas open-circuit voltage decreases with increase in thickness due to increase in electron diffusion length to the electrode. However, the Jsc and Voc of DSSC with a film thickness of 18.9&#x3BC;m (7.5mA/cm2 and 0.687V) are smaller than those of DSSC with a TiO2 film thickness of 13.5&#x3BC;m (9.9mA/cm2 and 0.734V). This is because the increased thickness of TiO2 thin film resulted in the decrease in the transmittance of TiO2 thin films hence reducing the incident light intensity on the N719 dye. Photovoltaic performance also depends greatly on the redox couple concentration in iodide&#x2216;triiodide. Jsc decreases as the redox concentration increases as a result of increased viscosity of the solution which lowers ion mobility. Similarly, Voc decreases as the electrolyte concentration increases due to enhanced back electron transfer reaction. An optimum power conversion efficiency of 4.3% was obtained in a DSSC with the TiO2 film thickness of 13.5&#x3BC;m and redox concentration of 0.03mol dm&#x2212;3 under AM 1.5G illumination at 100mW/cm2.

N2  - Stable-isotope analysis supplemented with stomach contents data from published sources was used to quantify the trophic niches, trophic niche overlaps and potential trophic redundancy for the most commonly caught fish species from an East African nearshore seagrass community. This assessment is an important first step in quantifying food-web structure in a region subject to intense fishing activities. Nearshore food webs were driven by at least two isotopically distinct trophic pathways, algal and seagrass, with a greater proportion of the sampled species feeding within the seagrass food web (57%) compared with the algal food web (33%). There was considerable isotopic niche overlap among species (92% of species overlapped with at least one other species). Narrow isotopic niche widths of most (83%) species sampled, low isotopic similarity (only 23% of species exhibited no differences in δ13 C and δ15 N) and low predicted trophic redundancy among fishes most commonly caught by fishermen (15%), however, suggest that adjustments to resource management concerning harvesting and gear selectivity may be needed for the persistence of artisanal fishing in northern Tanzania. More detailed trophic studies paired with information on spatio-temporal variation in fish abundance, especially for heavily targeted species, will assist in the development and implementation of management strategies to maintain coastal food-web integrity.

N2  - Microbial single-cell genomics can be used to provide insights into the metabolic potential, interactions, and evolution of uncultured microorganisms. Here we present WGA-X, a method based on multiple displacement amplification of DNA that utilizes a thermostable mutant of the phi29 polymerase. WGA-X enhances genome recovery from individual microbial cells and viral particles while maintaining ease of use and scalability. The greatest improvements are observed when amplifying high G+C content templates, such as those belonging to the predominant bacteria in agricultural soils. By integrating WGA-X with calibrated index-cell sorting and high-throughput genomic sequencing, we are able to analyze genomic sequences and cell sizes of hundreds of individual, uncultured bacteria, archaea, protists, and viral particles, obtained directly from marine and soil samples, in a single experiment. This approach may find diverse applications in microbiology and in biomedical and forensic studies of humans and other multicellular organisms.Single-cell genomics can be used to study uncultured microorganisms. Here, Stepanauskas et al. present a method combining improved multiple displacement amplification and FACS, to obtain genomic sequences and cell size information from uncultivated microbial cells and viral particles in environmental samples.

N2  - Microbial communities living in deeply buried sediment may be adapted to long-term energy limitation as they are removed from new detrital energy inputs for thousands to millions of years. However, sediment layers near the underlying oceanic crust may receive inputs from below that influence microbial community structure and/or activity. As part of the Census of Deep Life, we used 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing on DNA extracted from a spectrum of deep sediment-basement interface samples from the subsurface of the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank (collected on IODP Expedition 327) to examine this possible basement influence on deep sediment communities. This area experiences rapid sedimentation, with an underlying basaltic crust that hosts a dynamic flux of hydrothermal fluids that diffuse into the sediment. Chloroflexi sequences dominated tag libraries in all sediment samples, with variation in the abundance of other bacterial groups (e.g., Actinobacteria, Aerophobetes, Atribacteria, Planctomycetes, and Nitrospirae). These variations occur in relation to the type of sediment (clays versus carbonate-rich) and the depth of sample origin, and show no clear connection to the distance from the discharge outcrop or to basement fluid microbial communities. Actinobacteria-related sequences dominated the basalt libraries, but these should be viewed cautiously due to possibilities for imprinting from contamination. Our results indicate that proximity to basement or areas of seawater recharge is not a primary driver of microbial community composition in basal sediment, even though fluids diffusing from basement into sediment may stimulate microbial activity.

N2  - Ongoing bioremediation research seeks to promote naturally occurring microbial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation during and after oil spill events. However, complex relationships among functionally different microbial groups, nutrients and PAHs remain unconstrained. We conducted a surface water survey and corresponding nutrient amendment bioassays following the Texas City "Y" oil spill in Galveston Bay, Texas. Resident microbial groups, defined as either heterotrophic or autotrophic were enumerated by flow cytometry. Heterotrophic abundance was increased by oil regardless of nutrient concentrations. Contrastingly, autotrophic abundance was inhibited by oil, but this reaction was less severe when nutrient concentrations were higher. Several PAH compounds were reduced in nutrient amended treatments relative to controls suggesting nutrient enhanced microbial PAH processing. These findings provide a first-look at nutrient limitation during microbial oil processing in Galveston Bay, an important step in understanding if nutrient additions would be a useful bioremediation strategy in this and other estuarine systems.

N2  - Songs are distinct, patterned sounds produced by a variety of animals including baleen whales. Fin whale songs, which consist of short pulses repeated at regular interpulse intervals (IPIs), have been suggested as a tool to distinguish populations. Fin whale songs were analyzed from data collected from 2000-2012 in Southern California and from 2004-2010 in the Gulf of California using autonomous acoustic recorders. IPIs were measured for each identifiable song sequence during two random days of each month with recordings. Four distinct song types were identified: long doublet, short doublet, long triplet, and short triplet. Long and short doublets were the dominant songs in Southern California, while long and short triplets were dominant in the Gulf of California. An abrupt change in song type occurred in both areas during the monitoring period. We argue that each song type is unique to a population and these changes represent a shift in the primary population in the monitoring area. Occasional temporal and spatial song overlap indicated some exchange or visitation among populations. Fin whales appear to synchronize and gradually modify song rhythm over long time scales. A better understanding of the evolutionary and ecological importance of songs to fin whale populations is needed.

N2  - Iodine is a biophilic element that is important for human health, both as an essential component of several thyroid hormones and, on the other hand, as a potential carcinogen in the form of radioiodine generated by anthropogenic nuclear activity. Iodine exists in multiple oxidation states (-1, 0, +1, +3, +5, and +7), primarily as molecular iodine (I2), iodide (I-), iodate [Formula: see text] , or organic iodine (org-I). The mobility of iodine in the environment is dependent on its speciation and a series of redox, complexation, sorption, precipitation, and microbial reactions. Over the last 15years, there have been significant advances in iodine biogeochemistry, largely spurred by renewed interest in the fate of radioiodine in the environment. We review the biogeochemistry of iodine, with particular emphasis on the microbial processes responsible for volatilization, accumulation, oxidation, and reduction of iodine, as well as the exciting technological potential of these fascinating microorganisms and enzymes.

N2  - Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical dispersant, was intensively used during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Current studies surrounding Corexit have mainly focused on its toxicity and oil removal capacity. The potential impact of Corexit on the surface ocean carbon dynamics has remained largely unknown. The spontaneous assembly of DOM (dissolved organic matter) polymers into microgels (POM, particulate organic matter) was demonstrated previously that it can influence various critical processes, such as colloidal pump, microbial loops, and nutrition availability in the surface ocean. Here, we report that Corexit alone can significantly inhibit DOM microgel formation and reduce the stability of pre-existing microgels. However, Corexit and oil, Chemically Enhanced Water Accommodated Fraction (CEWAF), could effectively facilitate DOM microgel formation. The unanticipated disturbance of Corexit and oil spills on the critical DOM-POM continuum warrant particular caution and thus should be considered for future application of Corexit during oil spills.

N2  - <jats:sec><jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Purpose</jats:title>
<jats:p>The aim of this paper is to investigate the gap between cost-based and time-based revenue recognition schemes in the accounting of ship-owning corporations, and to propose cost-based revenue recognition (as in general accounting practice) in connection with the performance obligations.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec><jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>
<jats:p>For a comparative analysis of time-based (traditional approach) and cost-based schemes, a sample of dry bulk ships is selected and voyage estimations are performed by certified professional shipbrokers (Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers) (data collection and voyage estimation by practitioner). Performance obligations are also defined by certified shipbrokers (i.e. survey and expert opinion) and certified public accountant based on common shipping business practice and accounting practice in general.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec><jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Findings</jats:title>
<jats:p>Empirical results indicate the significant gap between two alternative schemes. Cost-based revenue recognition accelerates the revenue recognition (benefit of shipowner), and it enables comparability among other industries since cost-based allocation is the common practice in accounting (matching principle, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec><jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>
<jats:p>It is obviously impossible to observe all kinds of freight market transactions for all different kinds of vessel particulars. The sample size does not undervalue the current study since the central idea of this paper is not the verification of the cost-based recognition in all possible transactions.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec><jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Practical implications</jats:title>
<jats:p>The proposed approach debiases the existing recognition practice as well as improving the speed of revenue recognition. In the existing practice, time-based recognition is still based on voyage estimations (time estimation). Voyage estimations conventionally answer two questions: “What is the cost of the voyage?” and “What is the duration of the voyage?” Therefore, the proposed approach does not require any additional work done. Common practice also clarifies the cost-based schedule for revenue recognition.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec><jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Originality/value</jats:title>
<jats:p>This paper addresses the unconventional accounting practice and its incomparability problem for the first time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is also the first study on accounting economics of the shipping business. This paper proposes a practical solution to the debate raised by Financial Accounting Standards Board 2014-09 regulation on accounting standards by utilizing a staging approach and cost-based revenue allocation.</jats:p>

N2  - Recovery after hurricane events encourages new development activities and allows reconstruction through the conversion of naturally occurring wetlands to other land uses. This research investigates the degree to which hurricane recovery activities in coastal communities are undermining the ability of these places to attenuate the impacts of future storm events. Specifically, it explores how and to what extent wetlands are being affected by the CWA Section 404 permitting program in the context of post-Hurricane Ike 2008 recovery. Wetland alteration patterns are examined by selecting a control group (Aransas and Brazoria counties with no hurricane impact) vs. study group (Chambers and Galveston counties with hurricane impact) research design with a pretest-posttest measurement analyzing the variables such as permit types, pre-post Ike permits, land cover classes, and within-outside the 100-year floodplain. Results show that permitting activities in study group have increased within the 100-year floodplain and palustrine wetlands continue to be lost compare to the control group. Simultaneously, post-Ike individual and nationwide permits increased in the Hurricane Ike impacted area. A binomial logistic regression model indicated that permits within the study group, undeveloped land cover class, and individual and nationwide permit type have a substantial effect on post-Ike permits, suggesting that post-Ike permits have significant impact on wetland losses. These findings indicate that recovery after the hurricane is compromising ecological resiliency in coastal communities. The study outcome may be applied to policy decisions in managing wetlands during a long-term recovery process to maintain natural function for future flood mitigation.

N2  - We discovered a 50-cm-thick peat deposit near Cape Rasmussen (65.2°S), in the maritime Antarctic. To our knowledge, while aerobic 'moss banks' have often been examined, waterlogged 'peatlands' have never been described in this region before. The waterlogged system is approximately 100 m2, with a shallow water table. Surface vegetation is dominated by Warnstorfia fontinaliopsis, a wet-adapted moss commonly found in the Antarctic Peninsula. Peat inception was dated at 2750 cal. BP and was followed by relatively rapid peat accumulation (~0.1 cm/year) until 2150 cal. BP. Our multi-proxy analysis then shows a 2000-year-long stratigraphic hiatus as well as the recent resurgence of peat accumulation, sometime after 1950 AD. The existence of a thriving peatland at 2700-2150 cal. BP implies regionally warm summer conditions extending beyond the mid-Holocene; this finding is corroborated by many regional records showing moss bank initiation and decreased sea ice extent during this time period. Recent peatland recovery at the study site (<50 years ago) might have been triggered by ongoing rapid warming, as the area is experiencing climatic conditions approaching those found on milder, peatland-rich sub-Antarctic islands (50-60°S). Assuming that colonization opportunities and stabilization mechanisms would allow peat to persist in Antarctica, our results suggest that longer and warmer growing seasons in the maritime Antarctic region may promote a more peatland-rich landscape in the future.

N2  - Genotyping fish larvae is a valuable technique for numerous fields of study. While methods for collecting DNA from early stage larvae have been published, a non-lethal, non-invasive genotyping protocol for hatchlings that is amenable to high-throughput approaches is desirable. Here, we describe a method to individually genotype live, free-swimming, early fish larvae by characterizing their environmental DNA (eDNA). We demonstrate the utility of the method by assigning parentage to a sample (n = 50) of 3-5-day-old sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) larvae hatchlings, with very high rates of genotyping success (98%) and survival (92%) using mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA data. This method could be easily adapted to characterize early fish larvae from other model and non-model fish species, such as Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Medaka medaka.

N2  - Marine oil snow (MOS) formation is a mechanism to transport oil from the ocean surface to sediments. We describe here the use of 110L mesocosms designed to mimic oceanic parameters during an oil spill including the use of chemical dispersants in order to understand the processes controlling MOS formation. These experiments were not designed to be toxicity tests but rather to illustrate mechanisms. This paper focuses on the development of protocols needed to conduct experiments under environmentally relevant conditions to examine marine snow and MOS. The experiments required the production of over 500 liters of water accommodated fraction (WAF), chemically enhanced water accommodated fraction of oil (CEWAF) as well as diluted CEWAF (DCEWAF). A redesigned baffled (170 L) recirculating tank (BRT) system was used. Two mesocosm experiments (M1 and M2) were run for several days each. In both M1 and M2, marine snow and MOS was formed in controls and all treatments respectively. Estimated oil equivalent (EOE) concentrations of CEWAF were in the high range of concentrations reported during spills and field tests, while WAF and DCEWAF concentrations were within the range of concentrations reported during oil spills. EOE decreased rapidly within days in agreement with historic data and experiments.

N2  - Mercury (Hg) was discharged in the late 1960s into the Penobscot River by a chlor-alkali production facility, HoltraChem. Using total Hg concentration profiles from 56 stations (58 sediment cores) in the Penobscot River (PBR), Mendall Marsh (MM), Orland River (OR) and Penobscot Estuary (ES), and sediment accumulation rates derived using detailed profiles of total Hg concentrations and radionuclide activities (137Cs, 239,240Pu, 210Pb), recovery from system-wide Hg pollution was assessed. Total Hg concentration profiles showed sharp maxima at depths attributed in time to a 1967 release date, and were divided into two sections: the first 21years (1967-1988; rapid recovery), and the recent 21years (1988-2009; slower recovery). The recent 21years of Hg input were used to estimate 'apparent' recovery rates, yielding exponentially decreasing total Hg concentrations. Apparent recovery half-times (T1/2=ln2/α) were calculated from an exponential fit of Hg(t)=Hg(t=21)∗exp(-α∗t)+Hg(∞) to total Hg concentration profiles over the past 21years (assuming Hg(∞) of 0, 100, or 400ngg-1). Mean T1/2 values were, at PBR 31years (16 of 24 cores), at MM 22years (9 of 11 cores), at ES 20 to 120years (mean of 78years; 12 of 18 cores), and at OR 69years (3 of 5 cores). In 18 out of 57 cores, concentrations either increased towards the surface or remained the same, indicating slower or incomplete 'communication' with the larger system. The Penobscot River and Estuary system has recovered substantially since 1967, and top 1cm sediment Hg concentrations (Hg(0)) from areas in rapid communication with the larger system are converging to 600-700ngg-1 (1967 maxima of 70,000+ngg-1). However, to recover from Hg(0) of 700ngg-1 to a Hg(∞) of <100ngg-1 would require 3 or more half-times.

N2  - In order to examine the influence of the HA molecular composition on the partitioning of Pu, ten different kinds of humic acids (HAs) of contrasting chemical composition, collected and extracted from different soil types around the world were equilibrated with groundwater at low Pu concentrations (10-14 M). Under mildly acidic conditions (pH ∼ 5.5), 29 ± 24% of the HAs were released as colloidal organic matter (>3 kDa to <0.45 μm), yet this HA fraction accounted for a vast majority of the bound Pu, 76 ± 13% on average. In comparison, the particulate HA fraction bound only 8 ± 4% on average of the added Pu. The truly dissolved Pu fraction was typically <1%. Pu binding was strongly and positively correlated with the concentrations of organic nitrogen in both particulate (>0.45 μm) and colloidal phases in terms of activity percentage and partitioning coefficient values (logKd). Based on molecular characterization of the HAs by solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis, Pu binding was correlated to the concentration of carboxylate functionalities and nitrogen groups in the particulate and colloidal phases. The much greater tendency of Pu to bind to colloidal HAs than to particulate HA has implications on whether NOM acts as a Pu source or sink during natural or man-induced episodic flooding.

N2  - Given new distribution patterns of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (NARW; Eubalaena glacialis) population in recent years, an improved understanding of spatio-temporal movements are imperative for the conservation of this species. While so far visual data have provided most information on NARW movements, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) was used in this study in order to better capture year-round NARW presence. This project used PAM data from 2004 to 2014 collected by 19 organizations throughout the western North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, data from 324 recorders (35,600 days) were processed and analyzed using a classification and detection system. Results highlight almost year-round habitat use of the western North Atlantic Ocean, with a decrease in detections in waters off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina in summer and fall. Data collected post 2010 showed an increased NARW presence in the mid-Atlantic region and a simultaneous decrease in the northern Gulf of Maine. In addition, NARWs were widely distributed across most regions throughout winter months. This study demonstrates that a large-scale analysis of PAM data provides significant value to understanding and tracking shifts in large whale movements over long time scales.

N2  - Arctic river watersheds are important components of the global climate system and show an amplified response to climate change. Here, we characterize origins and transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in five major Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Yenisei, Ob, Mackenzie) over 3 years with seasonal sampling periods using measurements of carbohydrates, amino acids, bacterial biomarkers (D-amino acids), and plant protein biomarkers (hydroxyproline). A strong seasonal cycle of bioavailable DOM export was observed that correlated with discharge, vegetation, river morphology and water residence time. The chemical composition of bioavailable DOM was different among rivers reflecting unique characteristics of Arctic river watersheds. Trends in specific bacterial biomarkers were synchronous to changes in bacterial community compositions demonstrating that bacterial communities responded to the seasonal shifts in organic matter quality and chemical composition. Extensive heterotrophic processing of plant and soil-derived DOM resulted in major inputs of bacterial detritus, and bacterial organic matter accounted for 21-42% of DOC in all watersheds. Dissolved organic nitrogen sources were dominated by bacterially-derived nitrogen and important contributions of soluble plant protein during the Spring freshet. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of watershed characteristics and bacterial metabolism in regulating DOM composition, reactivity and carbon fluxes in Arctic river watersheds.

N2  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill stimulated the release of marine snow made up of dead/living plankton/bacteria and their exopolymeric polysaccharide substances (EPS), termed marine oil snow (MOS), promoting rapid removal of oil from the water column into sediments near the well site. Mesocosm simulations showed that Macondo surrogate oil readily associates with the marine snow. Quantitative solid-state 13C NMR readily distinguishes this oil from naturally formed marine snow and reveals that adding the dispersant Corexit enhances the amount of oil associated with the MOS, thus contributing to rapid removal from the water column. Solvent extraction of MOS removes the oil-derived compounds for analysis by one and two-dimensional GC/MS and evaluation of potential transformations they undergo when associated with the EPS. The results reveal that the oil associated with EPS is subjected to rapid transformation, in a matter of days, presumably by bacteria and fungi associated with EPS.

N2  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a persistent organic pollutant are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, which are causing serious environmental concerns. In this study, we chose BDE-47 as a representative PBDEs, to investigate its toxic effects on two microalgal species and the response of their antioxidant system. The results indicated Alexandrium minutum (a dinoflagellate) was more sensitive to BDE-47 than Dunaliella salina (a chlorophyte), as determined by growth rates, cellular structure and photosynthetic parameters. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were significantly elevated under the exposure of BDE-47 in both species, corresponding to an increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, while glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities decreased in D. salina and increased in A. minutum. The different enzymes responses between the two species indicated different mechanisms in their antioxidant system, and we deduced that A. minutum might have a higher efficiency for scavenging H2O2 than D. salina.

N2  - Latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients (LTG and ETG) play central roles in biogeographical theory, underpinning predictions of large-scale patterns in organismal thermal stress, species' ranges and distributional responses to climate change. Yet an enormous fraction of Earth's taxa live exclusively in habitats where foundation species modify temperatures. We examine little-explored implications of this widespread trend using a classic model system for understanding heat stresses - rocky intertidal shores. Through integrated field measurements and laboratory trials, we demonstrate that thermal buffering by centimetre-thick mussel and seaweed beds eliminates differences in stress-inducing high temperatures and associated mortality risk that would otherwise arise over 14° of latitude and ~ 1 m of shore elevation. These results reveal the extent to which physical effects of habitat-formers can overwhelm broad-scale thermal trends, suggesting a need to re-evaluate climate change predictions for many species. Notably, inhabitant populations may exhibit deceptive resilience to warming until refuge-forming taxa become imperiled.

N2  - Subterranean estuaries extend inland into density-stratified coastal carbonate aquifers containing a surprising diversity of endemic animals (mostly crustaceans) within a highly oligotrophic habitat. How complex ecosystems (termed anchialine) thrive in this globally distributed, cryptic environment is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a microbial loop shuttles methane and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to higher trophic levels of the anchialine food web in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico). Methane and DOC production and consumption within the coastal groundwater correspond with a microbial community capable of methanotrophy, heterotrophy, and chemoautotrophy, based on characterization by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and respiratory quinone composition. Fatty acid and bulk stable carbon isotope values of cave-adapted shrimp suggest that carbon from methanotrophic bacteria comprises 21% of their diet, on average. These findings reveal a heretofore unrecognized subterranean methane sink and contribute to our understanding of the carbon cycle and ecosystem function of karst subterranean estuaries.

N2  - Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), products from modern nanotechnologies, can potentially impact the marine environment to pose serious threats to marine ecosystems. However, the cellular responses of marine phytoplankton to ENPs are still not well established. Here, we investigate four different diatom species (Odontella mobiliensis, Skeletonema grethae, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Thalassiosira pseudonana) and one green algae (Dunaliella tertiolecta) for their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) release under model ENP treatments: 25 nm titanium dioxide (TiO2), 10-20 nm silicon dioxide (SiO2), and 15-30 nm cerium dioxide (CeO2). We found SiO2 ENPs can significantly stimulate EPS release from these algae (200-800%), while TiO2 ENP exposure induced the lowest release. Furthermore, the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration can be triggered by ENPs, suggesting that the EPS release process is mediated through Ca2+ signal pathways. With better understanding of the cellular mechanism mediated ENP-induced EPS release, potential preventative and safety measures can be developed to mitigate negative impact on the marine ecosystem.

N2  - Sea otters represent an interesting model for studies of mammalian feeding evolution. Although they are marine mammals, sea otters returned to the sea relatively recently and feed at the surface. Therefore, they represent a transitional stage of aquatic adaptation. Currently no feeding performance studies of sea otters have been conducted. The main objective of this study was to characterize the feeding kinematic profile in sea otters. It was hypothesized that sea otters would exhibit a terrestrial feeding behavior and that they forcefully crush hard prey at large gapes. As a result, biting kinematics would be congruent with biting behavior reported for their terrestrial ancestors, thus providing additional evidence that raptorial biting is a conserved behavior even in recently aquatic mammals. Sea otters consistently used a durophagous raptorial biting mode characterized by large gapes, large gape angles and lack of lateral gape occlusion. The shorter skulls and mandibles of sea otters, along with increased mechanical advantages of the masseter and increased bite force, form a repertoire of functional traits for durophagy. Here we consider durophagy to be a specialized raptorial biting feeding mode. A comparison of feeding kinematics of wild versus captive sea otters showed no significant differences in lateral kinematic profiles, and only minor differences in three frontal kinematic profiles, which included a slower maximum opening gape velocity, a slower maximum gape opening velocity, and a slower maximum closing gape velocity in captive sea otters. Data indicate functional innovations for producing large bite forces at wide gape and gape angles.

N2  - The vertical transport of sinking marine oil snow (MOS) and oil-sediment aggregations (OSA) during the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) spill contributed appreciably to the unexpected, and exceptional accumulation of oil on the seafloor. However, the role of the dispersant Corexit in mediating oil-sedimentation is still controversial. Here we demonstrate that the formation of diatom MOS is enhanced by chemically undispersed oil, but inhibited by Corexit-dispersed oil. Nevertheless, the sedimentation rate of oil may at times be enhanced by Corexit application, because of an elevated oil content per aggregate when Corexit is used. A conceptual framework explains the seemingly contradictory effects of Corexit application on the sedimentation of oil and marine particles. The redistribution of oil has central ecological implications, and future decisions on mediating measures or damage assessment will have to take the formation of sinking, oil-laden, marine snow into account.

N2  - RATIONALE: Application of vertebral chemistry in elasmobranchs has the potential to progress our understanding of individual migration patterns and population dynamics. However, the influence of handling artifacts such as sample cleaning and storage on vertebral chemistry is unclear and requires experimental investigation. METHODS: Vertebrae centra from blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) were cleaned with bleach (NaOCl) for 5 minutes (min), 1 hour (h) and 24 (h) in a cleaning experiment and stored frozen, in 70% ethanol, and 10% formalin treatments for 20 days in a storage experiment. Element concentrations (Li, Na, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ba, Pb) were quantified in the outer edges of vertebrae centra using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and the [element:Ca] molar ratios were compared among treatments and individual sharks. RESULTS: Bleach cleaning significantly increased [Na:Ca] and formalin storage decreased [Na:Ca] and [Mg:Ca], but ethanol storage did not affect any [element:Ca] ratios. Vertebrae edge [Sr:Ca], [Ba:Ca] and [Mn:Ca] varied among individual sharks, potentially reflecting different environments that they had previously inhabited. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows how archiving methods for vertebrae cartilage can affect primary element:Ca compositions. We demonstrate greatest element:Ca stabilities for vertebrae with limited bleach exposure that are either stored in ethanol or frozen, supporting the use of comparably archived sample sets in future elemental studies.

N2  - Anchialine caves are tidal, subterranean, inland habitats with a salinity-stratified water column and exchange of saltwater with the sea. They primarily occur on oceanic islands and some peninsulas with karstic limestone or volcanic terrain and include some of the longest explored caves on Earth. Use of specialized scientific cave-diving technology is essential to access this environment. A diverse, specially adapted fauna, dominated by crustaceans and other invertebrates, inhabit deeper, euhaline waters in anchialine caves. A number of new higher taxa, e.g., class Remipedia and order Mictacea, exclusively occur in this habitat. Some groups of anchialine fauna are found on opposite sides of oceans or even opposite sides of the Earth, and others have close relatives in the deep sea. Chemoautotrophically based food webs have been identified providing food in the otherwise lightless and nutrient-limited cave environment. Investigations of anchialine caves and their fauna by diving are a recent development so that much work remains. Only a small percentage of anchialine caves have been explored, much less scientifically studied, suggesting many new discoveries still wait.

N2  - Fluctuations in nutrient ratios over seasonal scales in aquatic ecosystems can result in overyielding, a condition arising when complementary life-history traits of coexisting phytoplankton species enables more complete use of resources. However, when nutrient concentrations fluctuate under short-period pulsed resource supply, the role of complementarity is less understood. We explore this using the framework of Resource Saturation Limitation Theory (r-strategists vs. K-strategists) to interpret findings from laboratory experiments. For these experiments, we isolated dominant species from a natural assemblage, stabilized to a state of coexistence in the laboratory and determined life-history traits for each species, important to categorize its competition strategy. Then, using monocultures we determined maximum biomass density under pulsed resource supply. These same conditions of resource supply were used with polycultures comprised of combinations of the isolated species. Our focal species were consistent of either r- or K-strategies and the biomass production achieved in monocultures depended on their efficiency to convert resources to biomass. For these species, the K-strategists were less efficient resource users. This affected biomass production in polycultures, which were characteristic of underyielding. In polycultures, K-strategists sequestered more resources than the r-strategists. This likely occurred because the intermittent periods of nutrient limitation that would have occurred just prior to the next nutrient supply pulse would have favored the K-strategists, leading to overall less efficient use of resources by the polyculture. This study provides evidence that fluctuation in resource concentrations resulting from pulsed resource supplies in aquatic ecosystems can result in phytoplankton assemblages' underyielding.

N2  - Sharks are a diverse group of mobile predators that forage across varied spatial scales and have the potential to influence food web dynamics. The ecological consequences of recent declines in shark biomass may extend across broader geographic ranges if shark taxa display common behavioural traits. By tracking the original site of photosynthetic fixation of carbon atoms that were ultimately assimilated into muscle tissues of 5,394 sharks from 114 species, we identify globally consistent biogeographic traits in trophic interactions between sharks found in different habitats. We show that populations of shelf-dwelling sharks derive a substantial proportion of their carbon from regional pelagic sources, but contain individuals that forage within additional isotopically diverse local food webs, such as those supported by terrestrial plant sources, benthic production and macrophytes. In contrast, oceanic sharks seem to use carbon derived from between 30° and 50° of latitude. Global-scale compilations of stable isotope data combined with biogeochemical modelling generate hypotheses regarding animal behaviours that can be tested with other methodological approaches.

N2  - The effect of life-history traits on resource competition outcomes is well understood in the context of a constant resource supply. However, almost all natural systems are subject to fluctuations of resources driven by cyclical processes such as seasonality and tidal hydrology. To understand community composition, it is therefore imperative to study the impact of resource fluctuations on interspecies competition. We adapted a well-established resource-competition model to show that fluctuations in inflow concentrations of two limiting resources lead to the survival of species in clumps along the trait axis, consistent with observations of "lumpy coexistence" [Scheffer M, van Nes EH (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:6230-6235]. A complex dynamic pattern in the available ambient resources arose very early in the self-organization process and dictated the locations of clumps along the trait axis by creating niches that promoted the growth of species with specific traits. This dynamic pattern emerged as the combined result of fluctuations in the inflow of resources and their consumption by the most competitive species that accumulated the bulk of biomass early in assemblage organization. Clumps emerged robustly across a range of periodicities, phase differences, and amplitudes. Given the ubiquity in the real world of asynchronous fluctuations of limiting resources, our findings imply that assemblage organization in clumps should be a common feature in nature.

N2  - Size, growth, and density have been studied for North American Pacific coast sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. droebachiensis, S. polyacanthus, Mesocentrotus (Strongylocentrotus) franciscanus, Lytechinus pictus, Centrostephanus coronatus, and Arbacia stellata by various workers at diverse sites and for varying lengths of time from 1956 to present. Numerous peer-reviewed publications have used some of these data but some data have appeared only in graduate theses or the gray literature. There also are data that have never appeared outside original data sheets. Motivation for studies has included fisheries management and environmental monitoring of sewer and power plant outfalls as well as changes associated with disease epidemics. Studies also have focused on kelp restoration, community effects of sea otters, basic sea urchin biology, and monitoring. The data sets presented here are a historical record of size, density, and growth for a common group of marine invertebrates in intertidal and nearshore environments that can be used to test hypotheses concerning future changes associated with fisheries practices, shifts of predator distributions, climate and ecosystem changes, and ocean acidification along the Pacific Coast of North America and islands of the north Pacific.

N2  - During the 20th century the impacts of industrialization and urbanization in Galveston Bay resulted in significant shifts in trace metals (Hg, Pb, Ni, Zn) and vascular plant biomarkers (lignin phenols) recorded within the surface sediments and sediment cores profile. A total of 22 sediment cores were collected in Galveston Bay in order to reconstruct the historical input of Hg, Pb, Ni, Zn and terrestrial organic matter. Total Hg (T-Hg) concentration ranged between 6 and 162 ng g-1 in surface sediments, and showed decreasing concentrations southward from the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) toward the open estuary. Core profiles of T-Hg and trace metals (Ni, Zn) showed substantial inputs starting in 1905, with peak concentrations between 1960 and 1970's, and decreasing thereafter with exception to Pb, which peaked around 1930-1940s. Stable carbon isotopes and lignin phenols showed an increasing input of terrestrial organic matter driven by urban development within the watershed in the early 1940s. Both the enrichment factor and the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) for T-Hg as a measure of the effectiveness of environmental management practices showed substantial improvements since the 1970s. The natural recovery rate in Galveston Bay since the peak input of T-Hg was non-linear and displayed a slow recovery during the twenty-first century.

N2  - Sediments from a waste pit in Houston Ship Channel (HSC) were characterized using a number of molecular markers of natural organic matter fractions (e.g., pyrogenic carbon residues, PAHs, lignins), in addition to dioxins, in order to test the hypothesis that the dispersal and mobility of dioxins from the waste pit in the San Jacinto River is minimal. Station SG-6, sampled at the site of the submerged waste pit, had the highest dioxin/furan concentrations reported for the Houston Ship Channel/Galveston Bay (HSC/GB) system (10,000-46,000 pg/g), which translated into some of the highest reported World Health Organization Toxic Equivalents (TEQs: 2000-11,000 pg/g) in HSC sediments. Using a multi-tracer approach, this study confirmed our hypothesis that sludges from chlorinated pulps are a very likely source of dioxins/furans to this pit. However, this material also contained large quantities of additional hydrophobic organic contaminants (PAHs) and pyrogenic markers (soot-BC, levoglucosan), pointing to the co-occurrence of petroleum hydrocarbons and combustion byproducts. Comparison of dioxin/furan signatures in the waste pit with those from sediments of the HSC and a control site suggests that the remobilization of contaminated particles did not occur beyond the close vicinity of the pit itself. The dioxins/furans in sediments outside the waste pit within the HSC are rather from other diffuse inputs, entering the sedimentary environment through the air and water, and which are comprised of a mixture of industrial and municipal sources. Fingerprinting of waste pit dioxins indicates that their composition is typical of pulp and paper sources. Measured pore water concentrations were 1 order of magnitude lower than estimated values, calculated from a multiphase sorption model, indicating low mobility of dioxins within the waste pit. This is likely accomplished by co-occurring and strong sorbing pyrogenic and petrogenic residues in the waste pit, which tend to keep dioxins strongly sorbed to particles.

N2  - The Atlantic bluefin tuna is a highly migratory species emblematic of the challenges associated with shared fisheries management. In an effort to resolve the species' stock dynamics, a genomewide search for spatially informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was undertaken, by way of sequencing reduced representation libraries. An allele frequency approach to SNP discovery was used, combining the data of 555 larvae and young-of-the-year (LYOY) into pools representing major geographical areas and mapping against a newly assembled genomic reference. From a set of 184,895 candidate loci, 384 were selected for validation using 167 LYOY. A highly discriminatory genotyping panel of 95 SNPs was ultimately developed by selecting loci with the most pronounced differences between western Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea LYOY. The panel was evaluated by genotyping a different set of LYOY (n = 326), and from these, 77.8% and 82.1% were correctly assigned to western Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea origins, respectively. The panel revealed temporally persistent differentiation among LYOY from the western Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (FST  = 0.008, p = .034). The composition of six mixed feeding aggregations in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea was characterized using genotypes from medium (n = 184) and large (n = 48) adults, applying population assignment and mixture analyses. The results provide evidence of persistent population structuring across broad geographic areas and extensive mixing in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly in the mid-Atlantic Bight and Gulf of St. Lawrence. The genomic reference and genotyping tools presented here constitute novel resources useful for future research and conservation efforts.

               <jats:p>The genetic basis of population structure in white marlin (Kajikia albida) is not well understood. Previous evaluation of genetic population structure in this species utilized a small number of molecular markers to survey genetic variation across opportunistically collected samples of adults, resulting in statistically significant levels of genetic differentiation for some pairwise comparisons and global levels of genetic differentiation that approached statistical significance. This study increased statistical power to improve resolution of genetic population structure in white marlin by surveying a larger number of molecular markers across sample collections of increased size, including collections from additional geographic locations and a robust collection of larvae. Increased statistical power resulted in lower levels of genetic heterogeneity compared with the previous study, and results were consistent with the presence of a single genetic stock of white marlin in the Atlantic Ocean. These results indicate that when statistical power is low, the ability to distinguish noise from a true signal of population structure is compromised. This relationship is especially important for population genetic assessments of marine fishes where genetic differentiation, if it exists, is expected to be low.</jats:p>

N2  - Global changes, such as increased temperatures and elevated CO2, are driving shifts in plant species distribution and dominance, like woody plant encroachment into grasslands. Local factors within these ecotones can influence the rate of regime shifts. Woody encroachment is occurring worldwide, though there has been limited research within coastal systems, where mangrove (woody shrub/tree) stands are expanding into salt marsh areas. Because coastal systems are exposed to various degrees of nutrient input, we investigated how nutrient enrichment may locally impact mangrove stand expansion and salt marsh displacement over time. We fertilized naturally co-occurring Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) stands in Port Aransas, TX, an area experiencing mangrove encroachment within the Northern Gulf of Mexico mangrove-marsh ecotone. After four growing seasons (2010-2013) of continuous fertilization, Avicennia was more positively influenced by nutrient enrichment than Spartina. Most notably, fertilized plots had a higher density of taller (> 0.5 m) mangroves and mangrove maximum height was 46% taller than in control plots. Fertilization may promote an increase in mangrove stand expansion within the mangrove-marsh ecotone by shifting Avicennia height distribution. Avicennia individuals, which reach certain species-specific height thresholds, have reduced negative neighbor effects and have higher resilience to freezing temperatures, which may increase mangrove competitive advantage over marsh grass. Therefore, we propose that nutrient enrichment, which augments mangrove height, could act locally as a positive feedback to mangrove encroachment, by reducing mangrove growth suppression factors, thereby accelerating the rates of increased mangrove coverage and subsequent marsh displacement. Areas within the mangrove-marsh ecotone with high anthropogenic nutrient input may be at increased risk of a regime shift from grass to woody dominated ecosystems.

               <jats:p>The spatio-temporal distribution pattern of Calanus sinicus, a key copepod species, was examined in the northern Yellow Sea (YS). Compared with 1959 and 1982, there was a significant increase in the abundance of C. sinicus in the spring, summer, and autumn of 2011 and winter of 2014. The percentage of C. sinicus in the zooplankton assemblages ranging from 45.6 to 75.8% in different seasons of 2011-2014 was significantly higher than that in 1982. Two different spatial distribution patterns of C. sinicus were observed, with higher abundance occurring nearshore during the cold season (e.g. January) and offshore in the central portion of the northern YS in the warm season (e.g. May, July, and October). The YS Cold Water Mass in the central portion of the northern YS likely provides an important over-summering site for the species. Additionally, a greater increase of the abundance of C. sinicus was found in the northern portion (the northern YS) of its spatial distribution during the past half century. This study has an implication on the climate-driven shifts in zooplankton community in the northern YS, highlighting the importance of C. sinicus in the warm-temperate ecosystem of Chinese coastal seas.</jats:p>

N2  - Uptake of six particle-reactive and/or redox-sensitive radionuclides (210Pb, 234Th, 7Be, 59Fe, 237Np and 233Pa) by 14 humic acids (HAs) was investigated in artificial groundwater under mildly acidic conditions (pH~5.5). In HA-groundwater slurry, Pb, Be, Fe and Pa bound strongly to particulate HA (>0.45 µm), supporting their application as tracers of soil erosion. Th bound strongly to the colloidal HA (3 kDa-0.45 µm) and as such, would not be a good candidate as a tracer for monitoring soil erosion. HAs likely reduced the oxidized neptunyl form (Np(V)O4+) to Np(IV) based on its enhanced particle-reactivity and Np uptake by particulate HAs, partially retarding the movement of anthropogenic 237Np in field polluted environments. Particulate/colloidal carbonyl/O-aryl (likely through hydroquinone/quinone) functionalities in the HA correlated to Np and Pa uptake, but only particulate O-aryl functionalities was responsible for Fe uptake. The carboxylate- and carbonyl/O-aryl-containing organic functionalities in the HA correlated strongly with Th uptake. In contrast, no significant correlations between organic parameters and Pb or Be uptake implied their predominance of uniform surface adsorption onto particles. This study provides novel insight into the binding of six radionuclides with different organic functionalities of three size fractions, as well as its possible impact on their application in the soil-tracing research.

N2  - The extent of increasing anthropogenic impacts on large marine vertebrates partly depends on the animals' movement patterns. Effective conservation requires identification of the key drivers of movement including intrinsic properties and extrinsic constraints associated with the dynamic nature of the environments the animals inhabit. However, the relative importance of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors remains elusive. We analyze a global dataset of ∼2.8 million locations from >2,600 tracked individuals across 50 marine vertebrates evolutionarily separated by millions of years and using different locomotion modes (fly, swim, walk/paddle). Strikingly, movement patterns show a remarkable convergence, being strongly conserved across species and independent of body length and mass, despite these traits ranging over 10 orders of magnitude among the species studied. This represents a fundamental difference between marine and terrestrial vertebrates not previously identified, likely linked to the reduced costs of locomotion in water. Movement patterns were primarily explained by the interaction between species-specific traits and the habitat(s) they move through, resulting in complex movement patterns when moving close to coasts compared with more predictable patterns when moving in open oceans. This distinct difference may be associated with greater complexity within coastal microhabitats, highlighting a critical role of preferred habitat in shaping marine vertebrate global movements. Efforts to develop understanding of the characteristics of vertebrate movement should consider the habitat(s) through which they move to identify how movement patterns will alter with forecasted severe ocean changes, such as reduced Arctic sea ice cover, sea level rise, and declining oxygen content.

N2  - Phytoplankton alter their macromolecule composition in response to changing environmental conditions. Often these changes are consistent and can be used as indicators to predict their exposure to a given condition. FTIR-spectroscopy is a powerful tool that provides rapid snapshot of microbial samples. We used FTIR to develop signature macromolecular composition profiles of three cultures: Skeletonema costatum, Emiliania huxleyi, and Navicula sp., exposed to chemically enhanced water accommodated oil fraction (CEWAF) in artificial seawater and control. Using a multivariate model created with a Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis of the FTIR-spectra, classification of CEWAF exposed versus control samples was possible. This model was validated using aggregate samples from a mesocosm study. Analysis of spectra and PCA-loadings plot showed changes to carbohydrates and proteins in response to CEWAF. Overall we developed a robust multivariate model that can be used to identify if a phytoplankton sample has been exposed to oil with dispersant.

N2  - Culture experiments were conducted on ten phytoplankton species to examine their biological and physiological responses during exposure to oil and a combination of oil and dispersant. The species tested included a range of taxa typically found in the Gulf of Mexico such as cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and diatoms. Cultures were exposed to Macondo surrogate oil using the water accommodated fraction (WAF), and dispersed oil using a chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) and diluted CEWAF, to replicate conditions following the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A range of responses were observed, that could broadly class the algae as either "robust" or "sensitive" to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Robust algae were identified as Synechococcus elongatus, Dunaliella tertiolecta, two pennate diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Navicula sp., and Skeletonema grethae CCMP775, and were largely unaffected by any of the treatments (no changes to growth rate or time spent in lag phase relative to controls). The rest of the phytoplankton, all centric diatoms, exhibited at least some combination of reduced growth rates or increased lag time in response to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Photophysiology did not have a strong treatment effect, with significant inhibition of photosynthetic efficiency (Fv /Fm ) only observed in the CEWAF, if at all. We found that the effects of oil and dispersants on phytoplankton physiology were species-dependent, and not always detrimental. This has significant implications on how oil spills might impact phytoplankton community structure and bloom dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico, which in turn impacts higher trophic levels.

N2  - During the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, massive quantities of oil were deposited on the seafloor via a large-scale marine oil-snow sedimentation and flocculent accumulation (MOSSFA) event. The role of chemical dispersants (e.g., Corexit) applied during the DWH oil spill clean-up in helping or hindering the formation of this MOSSFA event are not well-understood. Here, we present the first experiment related to the DWH oil spill to specifically investigate the relationship between microbial community structure, oil and Corexit®, and marine oil-snow in coastal surface waters. We observed the formation of micron-scale aggregates of microbial cells around droplets of oil and dispersant and found that their rate of formation was directly related to the concentration of oil within the water column. These micro-aggregates are potentially important precursors to the formation of larger marine oil-snow particles. Therefore, our observation that Corexit® significantly enhanced their formation suggests dispersant application may play a role in the development of MOSSFA events. We also observed that microbial communities in marine surface waters respond to oil and oil plus Corexit® differently and much more rapidly than previously measured, with major shifts in community composition occurring within only a few hours of experiment initiation. In the oil-amended treatments without Corexit®, this manifested as an increase in community diversity due to the outgrowth of several putative aliphatic- and aromatic-hydrocarbon degrading genera, including phytoplankton-associated taxa. In contrast, microbial community diversity was reduced in mesocosms containing chemically dispersed oil. Importantly, different consortia of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria responded to oil and chemically dispersed oil, indicating that functional redundancy in the pre-spill community likely results in hydrocarbon consumption in both undispersed and dispersed oils, but by different bacterial taxa. Taken together, these data improve our understanding of how dispersants influence the degradation and transport of oil in marine surface waters following an oil spill and provide valuable insight into the early response of complex microbial communities to oil exposure.

N2  - Extracellular enzymes and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play a key role in overall microbial activity, growth and survival in the ocean. EPS, being amphiphilic in nature, can act as biological surfactant in an oil spill situation. Extracellular enzymes help microbes to digest and utilize fractions of organic matter, including EPS, which can stimulate growth and enhance microbial activity. These natural processes might have been altered during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill due to the presence of hydrocarbon and dispersant. This study aims to investigate the role of bacterial extracellular enzymes during exposure to hydrocarbons and dispersant. Mesocosm studies were conducted using a water accommodated fraction of oil mixed with the chemical dispersant, Corexit (CEWAF) in seawater collected from two different locations in the Gulf of Mexico and corresponding controls (no additions). Activities of five extracellular enzymes typically found in the EPS secreted by the microbial community - α- and β-glucosidase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, leucine amino-peptidase - were measured using fluorogenic substrates in three different layers of the mesocosm tanks (surface, water column and bottom). Enhanced EPS production and extracellular enzyme activities were observed in the CEWAF treatment compared to the Control. Higher bacterial and micro-aggregate counts were also observed in the CEWAF treatment compared to Controls. Bacterial genera in the order Alteromonadaceae were the most abundant bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons recovered. Genomes of Alteromonadaceae commonly have alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase, therefore they may contribute significantly to the measured enzyme activities. Only Alteromonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae among bacteria detected here have higher percentage of genes for lipase. Piscirickettsiaceae was abundant; genomes from this order commonly have genes for leucine aminopeptidase. Overall, this study provides insights into the alteration to the microbial processes such as EPS and extracellular enzyme production, and to the microbial community, when exposed to the mixture of oil and dispersant.

N2  - We examined total mercury (Hg) distributions in sediments from the Penobscot River and estuary, Maine, a site of extensive Hg releases from HoltraChem (1967-2000). Our objectives were to quantify: (1) bottom sediment Hg inventories (upper ~1m; 50-100 y); (2) sediment accumulation rates; and (3) contemporary Hg fluxes to bottom sediments; by sampling the Penobscot River (PBR), Mendall Marsh (MM), the Orland River (OR) and the Penobscot estuary (ES). Hg was rapidly distributed here, and the cumulative total (9.28 metric tons) associated with sediments system-wide was within the range released (6-12 metric tons). Evidence of sediment/Hg remobilization was observed in cores primarily from the PBR, and to a lesser extent the ES, whereas cores from MM, most of the OR, the ES, and half from the PBR exhibited sharp peaks in Hg concentrations at depth, followed by gradual decreases towards the surface. Based on background PBR sediment Hg concentrations (100ngg-1), "elevated" (300ngg-1), or "highly elevated" (600ngg-1) Hg concentrations in sediments, and resulting inventories, we assessed impact levels ("elevated"≥270, or "highly elevated"≥540mgm-2). 71% of PBR stations had "elevated", and 29% had "highly elevated" Hg inventories; 45% of MM stations had "elevated", and 27% had "highly elevated" inventories; 80% of OR stations had "elevated" inventories only; and 17% of ES stations had "elevated" inventories only. Most "highly elevated" stations were located within 8km of HoltraChem, in MM, in the PBR, and in the OR. Near-surface sediments in the OR, PBR and MM were all "highly elevated", while those in the ES were "elevated", on average. Mean Hg fluxes to bottom sediments were greatest in the OR (554), followed by the PBR (469), then MM (452), and finally the ES (204ngcm-2y-1).

N2  - This study was performed to analyse the genetic and morphological diversity of the sabellid annelid genus Branchiomma, with special emphasis on a taxon so far identified as Branchiomma bairdi. This species, originally described from Bermuda, has frequently been reported as an invader in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific, but recent observations have raised some taxonomic questions. Samples of this taxon were collected from five sites in the Mediterranean Sea, two sites in the original distribution area of B. bairdi in the Gulf of Mexico and four localities in the east Pacific and Atlantic Oceans where B. bairdi has been reported as invasive. The molecular results revealed a conspicuous genetic divergence (18.5% K2P) between the sampled Mediterranean populations and all the other ones that led to a re-evaluation of their morphological characters. The latter showed that the Mediterranean and extra-Mediterranean populations also differ in some discrete morphological and reproductive features. Consequently, the Mediterranean samples were re-designated as B. boholense, another non-indigenous species originally described from Philippines. Branchiomma bairdi and B. boholense differ in body size, development and shape of micro and macrostylodes, size of radiolar eyes and body pigmentation. Genetic diversity was high in B. boholense from the Mediterranean as well as in B. bairdi from the Gulf of Mexico, but low in B. bairdi populations outside their native range. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of connections between the Mediterranean localities as well as between native and introduced B. bairdi populations that focus the attention on the Panama Canal as important passage for the introduction of the species from the Gulf of Mexico to the north-east Pacific Ocean.

N2  - Allelopathic species can alter biodiversity. Using simulated assemblages that are characterised by neutrality, lumpy coexistence and intransitivity, we explore relationships between within-assemblage competitive dissimilarities and resistance to allelopathic species. An emergent behaviour from our models is that assemblages are more resistant to allelopathy when members strongly compete exploitatively (high competitive power). We found that neutral assemblages were the most vulnerable to allelopathic species, followed by lumpy and then by intransitive assemblages. We find support for our modeling in real-world time-series data from eight lakes of varied morphometry and trophic state. Our analysis of this data shows that a lake's history of allelopathic phytoplankton species biovolume density and dominance is related to the number of species clusters occurring in the plankton assemblages of those lakes, an emergent trend similar to that of our modeling. We suggest that an assemblage's competitive power determines its allelopathy resistance.

N2  - There are increasing concerns about the impact of worsened physical condition on hypoxia in a variety of coastal systems, especially considering the influence of changing climate. In this study, an EOF analysis of the DO data for 1985-2012, a long-term numerical simulation of vertical exchange, and statistical analysis were applied to understand the underlying mechanisms for the variation of DO condition in Chesapeake Bay. Three types of analysis consistently demonstrated that both biological and physical conditions contribute equally to seasonal and interannual variations of the hypoxic condition in Chesapeake Bay. We found the physical condition (vertical exchange+temperature) determines the spatial and seasonal pattern of the hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay. The EOF analysis showed that the first mode, which was highly related to the physical forcings and correlated with the summer hypoxia volume, can be well explained by seasonal and interannual variations of physical variables and biological activities, while the second mode is significantly correlated with the estuarine circulation and river discharge. The weakened vertical exchange and increased water temperature since the 1980s demonstrated a worsened physical condition over the past few decades. Under changing climate (e.g., warming, accelerated sea-level rise, altered precipitation and wind patterns), Chesapeake Bay is likely to experience a worsened physical condition, which will amplify the negative impact of anthropogenic inputs on eutrophication and consequently require more efforts for nutrient reduction to improve the water quality condition in Chesapeake Bay.

N2  - American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) habitats are prone to saltwater intrusion following major storms, hurricanes or droughts. Anthropogenic impacts affecting hydrology of freshwater systems may exacerbate saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats. The endocrine system of alligators is susceptible to changes in the environment but it is currently not known how the crocodilian physiological system responds to environmental stressors such as salinity. Juvenile alligators were exposed to 12‰ saltwater for 5 weeks to determine the effects of chronic exposure to saline environments. Following 5 weeks, plasma levels of hormones [e.g. progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, corticosterone, aldosterone (ALDO), angiotensin II (ANG II)] were quantified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Compared with freshwater-kept subjects, saltwater-exposed alligators had significantly elevated plasma levels of corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, 17β-estradiol, estrone and estriol whereas pregnenolone and ANG II were significantly depressed and ALDO levels were unchanged (slightly depressed). On the one hand, saltwater exposure did not affect gene expression of renal mineralocorticoid and glucorticoid and angiotensin type 1 (AT-1) receptors or morphology of lingual glands. On the other hand, saltwater exposure significantly reduced plasma glucose concentrations whereas parameters diagnostic of perturbed liver function (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and kidney function (creatinine and creatine kinase) were significantly elevated. Except for plasma potassium levels (K+), plasma ions Na+ and Cl- were significantly elevated in saltwater alligators. Overall, this study demonstrated significant endocrine and physiological effects in juvenile alligators chronically exposed to a saline environment. Results provide novel insights into the effects of a natural environmental stressor (salinity) on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and steroidogenesis of alligators.

N2  - A novel cupric sulfate (CuSO4) oxidation method was developed to enable the analysis of dissolved lignin phenols in small volumes of open ocean seawater (<200 mL for deep ocean) or river water (<17 mL) samples. Dissolved lignin phenols were isolated by automated reversed-phase (octadecyl) extraction from seawater before oxidation, whereas for freshwater samples, oxidation was performed without prior extraction. Optimized reaction conditions using alkaline CuSO4 at 150 °C effectively limited losses of lignin phenols and suppressed side reactions at 5-100 μg of sample organic carbon. The method yielded up to ∼33% higher lignin phenol concentrations and 24-36% lower acid/aldehyde ratios of lignin phenols than existing CuO oxidation methods. The microscale design (200 μL reaction volume) resulted in extremely low blanks allowing accurate and precise quantification of lignin phenols. A comparison of silica-based octadecyl-bonded sorbents (C18) with copolymer-type sorbents (PPL) indicated that sorbent type affected concentrations and diagnostic ratios of dissolved lignin phenols. For robust intercomparability of measured lignin phenol concentrations and in consideration of method detection limits for quantification, a constant sample organic carbon content of ∼30 μg C and the addition of 150 μg ascorbic acid-C are recommended. Small sample volumes avoid time-consuming extraction steps in the field, and the simplified oxidation and sample processing procedures make the new method ideal for high-throughput analysis of dissolved lignin phenols in marine and freshwater environments.

N2  - Acoustic communication is an important aspect of reproductive, foraging and social behaviours for many marine species. Northeast Pacific blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) produce three different call types-A, B and D calls. All may be produced as singular calls, but A and B calls also occur in phrases to form songs. To evaluate the behavioural context of singular call and phrase production in blue whales, the acoustic and dive profile data from tags deployed on individuals off southern California were assessed using generalized estimating equations. Only 22% of all deployments contained sounds attributed to the tagged animal. A larger proportion of tagged animals were female (47%) than male (13%), with 40% of unknown sex. Fifty per cent of tags deployed on males contained sounds attributed to the tagged whale, while only a few (5%) deployed on females did. Most calls were produced at shallow depths (less than 30 m). Repetitive phrasing (singing) and production of singular calls were most common during shallow, non-lunging dives, with the latter also common during surface behaviour. Higher sound production rates occurred during autumn than summer and they varied with time-of-day: singular call rates were higher at dawn and dusk, while phrase production rates were highest at dusk and night.

N2  - Mercury (Hg) was discharged in the late 1960s into the Penobscot River by the Holtra-Chem chlor-alkali production facility, which was in operation from 1967 to 2000. To assess the transport and distribution of total Hg, and recovery of the river and estuary system from Hg pollution, physical and radiochemical data were assembled from sediment cores collected from 58 of 72 coring stations sampled in 2009. These stations were located throughout the lower Penobscot River, and included four principal study regions, the Penobscot River (PBR), Mendall Marsh (MM), the Orland River (OR), and the Penobscot estuary (ES). To provide the geochronology required to evaluate sedimentary total Hg profiles, 58 of 72 sediment cores were dated using the atmospheric radionuclide tracers 137Cs, 210Pb, and 239,240Pu. Sediment cores were assessed for depths of mixing, and for the determination of sediment accumulation rates using both geochemical (total Hg) and radiochemical data. At most stations, evidence for significant vertical mixing, derived from profiles of 7Be (where possible) and porosity, was restricted to the upper ~1-3cm. Thus, historic profiles of both total Hg and radionuclides were only minimally distorted, allowing a reconstruction of their depositional history. The pulse input tracers 137Cs and 239,240Pu used to assess sediment accumulation rates agreed well, while the steady state tracer 210Pb exhibited weaker agreement, likely due to irregular lateral sediment inputs.

N2  - A novel ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to enable the analysis of ultra-low levels of lignin phenols (<100 fmol) in environmental samples. The method included a sample clean-up with a polymer sorbent based solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase chromatography that allowed separation of all lignin phenols with minimal interference from co-eluting matrix components. The application of 13C-labeled surrogate standards effectively compensated for variability associated with sample preparation and ion suppression. The method was fully validated and compared to gas chromatography-electron impact ionization-tandem mass spectrometry for Suwannee River humic acid standard reference material and extracted riverine dissolved organic matter. The comparison demonstrated the robustness and suitability of the method for ultra-low lignin phenol concentrations and high matrix interference. The simple and fast sample preparation coupled to analysis without derivatization makes it feasible for routine and high-volume analyses.

N2  - Relatively few details of hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting ecology exist within the Arabian Gulf. Moreover, little is known about how their nesting dynamics compare to nesting populations throughout the rest of the world. Due to the extreme environmental setting, nesting ecology of hawksbills in the Arabian Gulf is of significant interest to researchers and conservationists. The current research reports on a long-term tagging and monitoring program undertaken at Fuwairit beach, Qatar. To investigate nesting behavior, site surveys and tagging were employed from 2010 to 2016. Presence of nests and clutch sizes were confirmed by excavation. Over the entire study period, nesting hawksbills had a mean curved carapace length of 70.8 cm (SD±2.8). A total 187 nests were confirmed, which contained a mean 78.9 eggs per clutch (SD±17.1), over an annual nesting season that lasted an average of 52.2 days (SD±6.3) from the start of April to the start of June. Meta-analysis with other global regions showed these characteristics to be significantly reduced when compared to nesting hawksbills from other populations. Meteorological data analysis showed air temperatures in the Arabian Gulf to increase on average 13.2°C (SD±0.26) from start to the end of nesting annually, which is significantly greater than other global nesting regions. Their smaller body size and reduced fecundity coupled with the extreme change in ambient air temperatures support the hypothesis that hawksbills in the region are more at risk than the already critically endangered hawksbill populations elsewhere in the world.

N2  - <jats:p>This study develops a site specific burn severity modelling using remote sensing techniques to develop severity patterns on vegetation and soil in the fire prone region of the Palo Verde National Park in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Terrain physical features, soil cover, and scorched vegetation characteristics were examined to develop a fire risk model and to quantify probable burned areas. Spectral signatures of affected areas were captured through multi-spectral analysis; i.e., Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Landsat derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and relativized dNBR (RdNBR). A partial unmixing algorithm, Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) was used to isolate endmembers for scorched vegetation and soil. The performance of dNBR and RdNBR for predicting ground cover components was acceptable with an overall accuracy of 84.4% and Cohen’s Kappa 0.82 for dNBR and an overall accuracy of 89.4% and Cohen’s Kappa 0.82 for RdNBR. Landsat derived RdNBR showed a strong correlation with scorched vegetation (r2 = 0.76) and moderate correlation with soil cover (r2 = 0.53), which outperformed dNBR. The ecologically diverse and unique park area is threatened by wetland fires, which pose a potential threat to various species. Human induced fires by poachers are a common occurrence in such areas to gain access to these species. This paper aims to prioritize areas that are at a higher risk from fire and model spatial adaptations in relation to the direction of fire within the affected wetlands. This assessment will help wildlife personnel in managing disturbed wetland ecosystems.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>The potential of subterranean environments as models to address major evolutionary and ecological questions has been highlighted in the literature. They represent partially isolated, discrete units offering several replicates of the same evolutionary processes. Species occurrence data of these environments is abundant, although sparse in the literature or gathered in databases established according to regional, taxonomical, or ecological criteria. We here present a newly assembled dataset consisting of records of aquatic animals in all types of caves or wells from all over the world. Literature sources were gathered from Google Scholar by independently searching for each metazoan phylum/arthropod order, as well as the key words “cave”, “groundwater”, “well”, or “stygobite”, in English, Galician, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalonian, French, Italian, Hungarian, Greek, German, Polish, Russian, and Serbo-Croatian. The relevance of each source was confirmed after checking the title and the abstract. For each selected source, we examined its reference list in order to identify studies that were not published in journals indexed in the databases we searched. From the 6852 selected references, we manually extracted all records that concerned either</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Records were classified as primary or secondary, depending on whether they provided new information or referred to already publish records, allowing us to identify redundant information in posterior analyses. Information for each access point was organized in as a gazetteer, including synonym names, geographical, ecological, and geological information. Following this strategy, we have obtained 48,800 records (32,769, primary) from 1957 references checked so far. Most records are amongst fish and crustaceans. In contrast, few data exist for other groups that are comparatively diverse outside caves, such as Nematoda. Relevant information will be included in World Register of Marine Cave Species (Fig. 1).</jats:p>

N2  - The feeding ecology of two reef fishes associated with artificial reefs in the northwest Gulf of Mexico (GoM) was examined using gut contents and natural stable isotopes. Reefs were divided into three regions (east, central, west) across an east to west gradient of increasing reef complexity and salinity. Gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) primarily consumed reef-associated prey (xanthid crabs, bivalves, barnacles) and pelagic gastropods, while red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) diets were mainly comprised of non-reef prey (stomatopods, fishes, portunid crabs). Natural stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and sulfur (δ34S) were measured in consumer muscle tissue as well as potential primary producers. Gray triggerfish occupied a lower trophic position than red snapper, with lower δ13C and δ15N values across all size classes and regions, and generally higher δ34S values. Red snapper had a smaller range of stable isotope values and corrected standard ellipse areas across all size classes and regions, indicating a smaller isotopic niche. Contribution estimates of particulate organic matter (26 to 54%) and benthic microalgae (BMA, 47 to 74%) for both species were similar, with BMA contributions greater across all three size classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) of red snapper and all but the juvenile size class for gray triggerfish. Species gut contents and stable isotopes differed by region, with fishes consuming more crabs in the east region and more gastropods in the central and west regions. δ13C and δ15N values generally decreased from east to west, while δ34S increased across this gradient. Results highlight species-specific feeding differences associated with artificial reefs, where gray triggerfish may be more dependent on the reef structure for foraging opportunities. In addition, results offer further information on the integral role of BMA in primary production at nearshore artificial reefs.

N2  - Oocyte development and maturation (or oogenesis) in spawning female fish is mediated by interrelated transcriptional regulatory and steroidogenesis networks. This study integrates a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) model of steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions with a flux balance analysis (FBA) model of steroidogenesis. The two models were functionally related. Output from the TRN model (as magnitude gene expression simulated using extreme pathway (ExPa) analysis) was used to re-constrain linear inequality bounds for reactions in the FBA model. This allowed TRN model predictions to impact the steroidogenesis FBA model. These two interrelated models were tested as follows: First, in silico targeted steroidogenic enzyme gene activations in the TRN model showed high co-regulation (67-83%) for genes involved with oocyte growth and development (cyp11a1, cyp17-17,20-lyase, 3β-HSD and cyp19a1a). Whereas, no or low co-regulation corresponded with genes concertedly involved with oocyte final maturation prior to spawning (cyp17-17α-hydroxylase (0%) and 20β-HSD (33%)). Analysis (using FBA) of accompanying steroidogenesis fluxes showed high overlap for enzymes involved with oocyte growth and development versus those involved with final maturation and spawning. Second, the TRN model was parameterized with in vivo changes in the presence/absence of transcription factors (TFs) during oogenesis in female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Oogenesis stages studied included: PreVitellogenic-Vitellogenic, Vitellogenic-Mature, Mature-Ovulated and Ovulated-Atretic stages. Predictions of TRN genes active during oogenesis showed overall elevated expressions for most genes during early oocyte development (PreVitellogenic-Vitellogenic, Vitellogenic-Mature) and post-ovulation (Ovulated-Atretic). Whereas ovulation (Mature-Ovulated) showed highest expression for cyp17-17α-hydroxylase only. FBA showed steroid hormone productions to also follow trends concomitant with steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions. General trends predicted by in silico modeling were similar to those observed in vivo. The integrated computational framework presented was capable of mechanistically representing aspects of reproductive function in fish. This approach can be extended to study reproductive effects under exposure to adverse environmental or anthropogenic stressors.

N2  - <jats:p> East Africa and India have recently been proposed as places of origin for leprosy, based primarily on the geographical mapping of sixteen single-nucleotide polymorphism subtypes (snps). When comparing these data with historical texts, however, obstacles become apparent for both interpretations. Large population movements, a lack of divergence date ranges for some snp subtypes, and the discovery of a second strain of leprosy further complicate the geography of the disease. Dated skeletons with snp subtypes and molecular data, along with the informed collaboration of historical evidence, are key to determining the place of origin for both leprosy species. </jats:p>

N2  - During the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the chemical dispersant Corexit was applied over vast areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Marine phytoplankton play a key role in aggregate formation through the production of extracellular polymeric materials (EPS), an important step in the biological carbon pump. This study examined the impacts of oil and dispersants on the composition and physiology of natural marine phytoplankton communities from the Gulf of Mexico during a 72-hour mesocosm experiment and consequences to carbon export. The communities were treated using the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, which was produced by adding Macondo surrogate oil to natural seawater and mixed for 24 h in the dark. A chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) was made in a similar manner, but using a mixture of oil and the dispersant Corexit in a 20:1 ratio as well as a diluted CEWAF (DCEWAF). Phytoplankton communities exposed to WAF showed no significant changes in PSII quantum yield (Fv/Fm) or electron transfer rates (ETRmax) compared to Control communities. In contrast, both Fv/Fm and ETRmax declined rapidly in communities treated with either CEWAF or DCEWAF. Analysis of other photophysiological parameters showed that photosystem II (PSII) antenna size and PSII connectivity factor were not altered by exposure to DCEWAF, suggesting that processes downstream of PSII were affected. The eukaryote community composition in each experimental tank was characterized at the end of the 72 h exposure time using 18S rRNA sequencing. Diatoms dominated the communities in both the control and WAF treatments (52 and 56% relative abundance respectively), while in CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments were dominated by heterotrophic Euglenozoa (51 and 84% respectively). Diatoms made up the largest relative contribution to the autotrophic eukaryote community in all treatments. EPS concentration was four times higher in CEWAF tanks compared to other treatments. Changes in particle size distributions (a proxy for aggregates) over time indicated that a higher degree of particle aggregation occurred in both the CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments than the WAF or Controls. Our results demonstrate that chemically dispersed oil has more negative impacts on photophysiology, phytoplankton community structure and aggregation dynamics than oil alone, with potential implications for export processes that affect the distribution and turnover of carbon and oil in the water column.

N2  - As upper-level predators, sharks are important for maintaining marine food web structure, but populations are threatened by fishery exploitation. Sustainable management of shark populations requires improved understanding of migration patterns and population demographics, which has traditionally been sought through physical and/or electronic tagging studies. The application of natural tags such as elemental variations in mineralized band pairs of elasmobranch vertebrae cartilage could also reveal endogenous and exogenous processes experienced by sharks throughout their life histories. Here, elemental profiles were characterized in vertebrae encompassing complete life histories (birth-to-death) of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) of known tag and recapture locations in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. All sharks were injected with oxytetracycline at initial capture, released and subsequently recaptured, with individual liberty times ranging from 215 days to 6 years. Vertebral band pairs forming over the liberty intervals were verified by counting the number of band pairs deposited since the oxytetracycline band. Regular oscillations in vertebrae manganese (Mn) content corresponded well with the number of validated band pairs, suggesting that Mn variation could be used to age sharks. Increases in vertebrae barium concentration were correlated with times when individuals occupied areas with high coastal upwelling indices, the timing and spatial intensity of which varied from year to year. Interspecific relationships were probably influenced by behavioural differences in horizontal and vertical habitat use, feeding habits and thermoregulatory physiology. These results indicate that vertebral sclerochronology has the potential to advance our knowledge of elasmobranch life history including age and growth estimation and environmental reconstruction.

<jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Purpose</jats:title>
<jats:p>The maritime industry is increasingly impacted by the Internet of things (IoT) through the automation of ships and port activities. This increased automation creates new security vulnerabilities for the maritime industry in cyberspace. Any obstruction in the global supply chain due to a cyberattack can cause catastrophic problems in the global economy. This paper aims to review automatic identification systems (AISs) aboard ships for cyber issues and weaknesses.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>
<jats:p>The authors do so by comparing the results of two receiver systems of the AIS in the Port of Houston; the JAMSS system aboard the Space Station and the “Harborlights” system for traffic control in the Port.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Findings</jats:title>
<jats:p>The authors find that inconsistent information is presented on the location of same ships at the same time in the Port. Upon further investigation with pilots, the authors find that these inconsistencies may be the result of the strength of power with which an AIS is transmitted. It appears the power may be reduced to the AIS in port but that it varies within port and varies by pilot operators. This practice may open the AIS system for tampering.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type="abstract-subheading">Originality/value</jats:title>
<jats:p>Further, this inconsistency may require further policy regulation to properly address cyber information in a port.</jats:p>

N2  - Sinking marine oil snow was found to be a major mechanism in the transport of spilled oil from the surface to the deep sea following the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill. Marine snow formation is primarily facilitated by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are mainly composed of proteins and carbohydrates secreted by microorganisms. While numerous bacteria have been identified to degrade oil, there is a paucity of knowledge on bacteria that produce EPS in response to oil and Corexit exposure in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). In this study, we isolated bacteria from surface water of the nGoM that grow on oil or Corexit dispersant. Among the 100 strains isolated, nine were identified to produce remarkable amounts of EPS. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that six isolates (strains C1, C5, W10, W11, W14, W20) belong to the genus Alteromonas; the others were related to Thalassospira (C8), Aestuariibacter (C12), and Escherichia (W13a). The isolates preferably degraded alkanes (17-77%), over polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (0.90-23%). The EPS production was determined in the presence of a water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, a chemical enhanced WAF (CEWAF), Corexit, and control. The highest production of visible aggregates was found in Corexit followed by CEWAF, WAF, and control; indicating that Corexit generally enhanced EPS production. The addition of WAF and Corexit did not affect the carbohydrate content, but significantly increased the protein content of the EPS. On the average, WAF and CEWAF treatments had nine to ten times more proteins, and Corexit had five times higher than the control. Our results reveal that Alteromonas and Thalassospira, among the commonly reported bacteria following the DwH spill, produce protein rich EPS that could have crucial roles in oil degradation and marine snow formation. This study highlights the link between EPS production and bacterial oil-degrading capacity that should not be overlooked during spilled oil clearance.

N2  - We present an extension of the Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) standard for reporting sequences of uncultivated virus genomes. Minimum Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome (MIUViG) standards were developed within the Genomic Standards Consortium framework and include virus origin, genome quality, genome annotation, taxonomic classification, biogeographic distribution and in silico host prediction. Community-wide adoption of MIUViG standards, which complement the Minimum Information about a Single Amplified Genome (MISAG) and Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MIMAG) standards for uncultivated bacteria and archaea, will improve the reporting of uncultivated virus genomes in public databases. In turn, this should enable more robust comparative studies and a systematic exploration of the global virosphere.

N2  - Whales use baleen, a novel integumentary structure, to filter feed; filter feeding itself evolved at least five times in tetrapod history but demonstrably only once in mammals [1]. Living baleen whales (mysticetes) are born without teeth, but paleontological and embryological evidence demonstrate that they evolved from toothed ancestors that lacked baleen entirely [2]. The mechanisms driving the origin of filter feeding in tetrapods remain obscure. Here we report Maiabalaena nesbittae gen. et sp. nov., a new fossil whale from early Oligocene rocks of Washington State, USA, lacking evidence of both teeth and baleen. The holotype possesses a nearly complete skull with ear bones, both mandibles, and associated postcrania. Phylogenetic analysis shows Maiabalaena as crownward of all toothed mysticetes, demonstrating that tooth loss preceded the evolution of baleen. The functional transition from teeth to baleen in mysticetes has remained enigmatic because baleen decays rapidly and leaves osteological correlates with unclear homology; the oldest direct evidence for fossil baleen is ∼25 million years younger [3] than the oldest stem mysticetes (∼36 Ma). Previous hypotheses for the origin of baleen [4, 5] are inconsistent with the morphology and phylogenetic position of Maiabalaena. The absence of both teeth and baleen in Maiabalaena is consistent with recent evidence that the evolutionary loss of teeth and origin of baleen are decoupled evolutionary transformations, each with a separate morphological and genetic basis [2, 6]. Understanding these macroevolutionary patterns in baleen whales is akin to other macroevolutionary transformations in tetrapods such as scales to feathers in birds.

N2  - China is a massive mercury emitter, responsible for a quarter of the world's mercury emissions, which transit the atmosphere and accumulate throughout its watercourses. The Changjiang (Yangtze) River is the third largest river in the world, integrating mercury emissions over its 1.8 × 106 km2 catchment and channelling them to the East China Sea where they can be buried. Despite its potential global significance, the importance of the East China Sea as a terminal mercury sink remains poorly known. To address this knowledge gap, total mercury and methylmercury concentrations were determined from 51 surface sediment samples revealing their spatial distribution, whilst demonstrating the overall pollution status of the East China Sea. Sedimentary mercury distributions beneath the East China Sea are spatially heterogeneous, with high mercury concentrations (> 25 ng g-1) corresponding to areas of fine-grained sediment accumulation. In contrast, some sites of fine-grained sediment deposition have significantly lower values of methylmercury (< 15 ng g-1), such as the Changjiang estuary and some isolated offshore areas. Fine-grained particles and organic matter availability appear to exert the dominant control over sedimentary mercury distribution in the East China Sea, whereas in situ methylation serves as an additional control governing methylmercury accumulation. Estimated annual sedimentary fluxes of mercury in the East China Sea are 51 × 106 g, which accounts for 9% of China's annual mercury emissions.

Here, we consider consequences of such perturbations for organism biomechanics and linkages amongst species within communities. In particular, we examine case examples of altered morphologies and material properties, disrupted consumer-prey behaviours, and the potential for modulated positive (i.e. facilitative) interactions amongst taxa, as incurred through increasing ocean acidity and rising temperatures. We focus on intertidal rocky shores of temperate seas as model systems, acknowledging the longstanding role of these communities in deciphering ecological principles. Our survey illustrates the broad capacity for biomechanical and behavioural shifts in organisms to influence the ecology of a transforming world.

N2  - <jats:p> To better understand the alteration of the estuarine circulation caused by estuarine dams, four major Korean estuaries were classified by using the Hansen and Rattray stratification–circulation classification scheme. The stratification and circulation parameters were calculated for both discharge and no-discharge periods from the tidally averaged salinity and velocity data obtained from these four Korean estuaries. The estuarine types of the altered Korean estuaries were compared with the previous results for natural estuaries in other countries of similar magnitude in tidal range, water depth, and discharge. This comparison revealed that the estuarine types of the altered Korean estuaries have been shifted from a partially mixed to a well-mixed type (Nakdong River Estuary), from a partially mixed to a coastal bay or a fjord type (Yeongsan River Estuary), and from a well-mixed to a well-mixed type with less tidal modulation (Geum River Estuary). The controlling factors that determined the type in natural estuaries were tide, discharge, and water depth, whereas for altered estuaries, they were the controlled river discharge and water depth. The different estuarine dam gate types with their different modes of operation (surface or bottom discharge) played an important role in the mixing and circulation of the altered estuaries. </jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Let G be a graph with vertex set V (G). For any two distinct vertices x and y

   dimension of graphs. For a connected graph G and k?[1,k(G)], it's easy to
   see that k ? dimkf(G)? k|V(G)|/k(G); we characterize graphs G satisfying
   dimkf(G)=k and dimkf(G)=|V(G)| respectively. We show that dimkf(G)
   ? k dimf(G) for any k ? [1,k(G)], and we give an example showing that
   dimkf(G)- k dimf(G) can be arbitrarily large for some k?(1,k(G)];
   we also describe a condition for which dimkf(G) = kdimf(G) holds. We
   determine the fractional k-metric dimension for some classes of graphs, and
   conclude with two open problems, including whether ?(k) = dimkf(G) is a
   continuous function of k on every connected graph G.</jats:p>

N2  - Chemical characterization of the presence of oil in environmental samples are performed using methods of varying complexity. Extraction of samples with an organic solvent and analysis by fluorescence spectrometry has been shown to be a rapid and effective screening technique for petroleum in the environment. During experiments, rapid analysis of oil by fluorescence provides the opportunity for researchers to modify the experimental conditions in real time. Estimated Oil Equivalents (EOE) relies on the fluorescence measurement of the aromatic compounds to estimate the oil concentration. The present intercalibration study was designed to investigate whether different fluorometer instruments can reliably measure EOE and whether the results are intercomparable. Additionally, the need for extraction of oil compounds into an organic solvent was investigated. Three different fluorometers were used in three different laboratories: a Horiba Aqualog, a Turner Trilogy and a Shimadzu Spectrofluorophotometer RF-1501. Results from these different instruments showed excellent agreement for EOE determinations. A very high correlation was found between the EOE results obtained with Aqualog Horiba and Turner Trilogy (r2 = 0.9999), with no significant differences between the mean EOE results (t-test, p = 0.30), and the Aqualog Horiba and Shimadzu (r2 = 0.995) fluorometers, with no statistically difference between the EOE results obtained by the two instruments (p = 0.40).

N2  - © 2019 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System. In this paper, we empirically examine whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Public Assistance (PA) program, which targets postdisaster cleanup and infrastructure rehabilitation, affects household purchases of flood insurance. Using the fixed-effects model with instrumental variables to address the endogeneity of disaster aid, we find that increased PA grants reduce a county's flood insurance take-up rates, thereby driving down its total insurance coverage and premiums paid. Our findings provide empirical evidence on the crowding-out effect of public disaster programs, and shed light on their implicit social costs and increased federal financial exposure to natural disasters and climate change.

N2  - The timing and extent of international crossings by billfishes, tunas, and sharks in the Cuba-Mexico-United States (U.S.) triangle was investigated using electronic tagging data from eight species that resulted in >22,000 tracking days. Transnational movements of these highly mobile marine predators were pronounced with varying levels of bi- or tri-national population connectivity displayed by each species. Billfishes and tunas moved throughout the Gulf of Mexico and all species investigated (blue marlin, white marlin, Atlantic bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna) frequently crossed international boundaries and entered the territorial waters of Cuba and/or Mexico. Certain sharks (tiger shark, scalloped hammerhead) displayed prolonged periods of residency in U.S. waters with more limited displacements, while whale sharks and to a lesser degree shortfin mako moved through multiple jurisdictions. The spatial extent of associated movements was generally associated with their differential use of coastal and open ocean pelagic ecosystems. Species with the majority of daily positions in oceanic waters off the continental shelf showed the greatest tendency for transnational movements and typically traveled farther from initial tagging locations. Several species converged on a common seasonal movement pattern between territorial waters of the U.S. (summer) and Mexico (winter).

N2  - Tissue-based burdens of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were integrated with ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity in bull (Carcharhinus leucas), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) sharks from Galveston Bay, TX. The potential toxicity of these burdens was evaluated by calculation of toxic equivalents (TEQs). Concentrations of total PAHs (∑PAHs) were significantly greater in blacktip and bonnethead sharks than bull sharks in liver, but did not exhibit differences in muscle among species. Hepatic concentrations of ∑PAHs in these sharks (range of means: 1560-2200 ng/g wet wt.) were greater than concentrations previously reported in oysters from Galveston Bay (range of means: 134-333 ng/g dry wt.), which suggests that trophic dilution of PAHs may not be reflected in sharks. Total PCBs (∑PCBs) were significantly greatest in bull sharks and lowest in bonnetheads, while blacktips were intermediate to these species. EROD activity was greater in bonnetheads than the other species, whereas GST activity was significantly higher in blacktips and bonnetheads than in bull sharks. Integration of hepatic burdens with biomarker activity via constrained multivariate analysis found correlations for only a small number of individual PAH/PCB congeners. Hepatic TEQ measurements suggest potential physiological effects of these burdens compared to established TEQ thresholds for other taxa, although the likelihood of similar effects in sharks requires further study and the inclusion of toxic endpoints. Our findings indicate that sharks may be prone to the accumulation of PAHs and PCBs, which may result in negative health outcomes for these cartilaginous fishes.

N2  - <jats:p> We develop a county-level recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Orleans Parish (OP) to examine local economic impacts of migration and brain drain after Hurricane Katrina. To incorporate hurricane-induced brain drain in the CGE model, we use a reduced-form model to estimate the change in the share of college graduates caused by hurricane-induced damages. Calibrating the model using pre-disaster social accounting matrices (SAMs) in 2004, we find that permanent loss in population and skilled labor results in 33.57% decline in county-level gross regional product (GRP) in 2012 relative to the 2012 business as usual scenario (BAU) that assumes steady annual growth without Hurricane Katrina. Interestingly, we find that skill loss causes larger decline in GRP than overall decline in population. After accounting for post-disaster public assistance by recalibrating model using 2012 SAMs, we find a lower declining rate of 6.36% in GRP. </jats:p>

N2  - Ontogenetic niche shifts are widespread. However, individual differences in size at birth, morphology, sex, and personalities can cause variability in behavior. As such, inherent inter-individual differences within populations may lead to context-dependent changes in behavior with animal body size, which is of concern for understanding population dynamics and optimizing ecological monitoring. Using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values from concurrently sampled tissues, we quantified the direction and magnitude of intraspecific variation in trophic shifts among three shark species, and how these changed with body size: spurdogs (Squalus spp.) in deep-sea habitats off La Réunion, bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in estuarine habitats of the Florida Everglades, and blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in coral reef ecosystems of Moorea, French Polynesia. Intraspecific variation in trophic shifts was limited among spurdogs, and decreased with body size, while bull sharks exhibited greater individual differences in trophic shifts, but also decreased in variability through ontogeny. In contrast, blacktip reef sharks exhibited increased intraspecific variation in trophic interactions with body size. Variability in trophic interactions and ontogenetic shifts are known to be associated with changes in energetic requirements, but can vary with ecological context. Our results suggest that environmental stability may affect variability within populations, and ecosystems with greater spatial and/or temporal variability in environmental conditions, and those with more diverse food webs may facilitate greater individual differences in trophic interactions, and thus ontogenetic trophic shifts. In light of concerns over environmental disturbance, elucidating the contexts that promote or dampen phenotypic variability is invaluable for predicting population- and community-level responses to environmental changes.

N2  - Hurricane Harvey, one of the worst hurricanes that hit the United States in recent history, poured record-breaking rainfall across the Houston metropolitan area. Based on a comprehensive set of data from various sources, we examined the dramatic responses in hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes of Galveston Bay to this extreme event. Using a freshwater fraction method that circumvents the uncertainties in surface runoff and groundwater discharge, the freshwater load into the bay during Harvey and the following month was estimated to be 11.1 × 109 m3, about 3 times the bay volume, which had completely refreshed the entire bay. Harvey also delivered 9.86 × 107 metric tons of sediment into the bay, equivalent to 18 years of average annual sediment load. At a site inside the San Jacinto Estuary, acute bed erosion of 48 cm followed by deposition of 22 cm of new sediment was observed from the sediment cores. Slow salinity recovery (~2 month) and a thick flood deposit (~10.5 cm average over the entire bay) had likely impacted the ecosystem in the bay and the adjacent inner shelf. Estuaries with similar bathymetric and geometric characteristics, i.e., shallow bathymetry with narrow outlets, are expected to experience similar dramatic estuarine responses while extreme precipitation events are expected to occur more frequently under the warming climate.

N2  - Organic matter export from the euphotic zone is a key component of oceanic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. Although interactions between these two cycles are important, studies on geochemical processes to directly connect them are limited. Here we show that sunlight can induce chemical aggregation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into high N containing photo-aggregates. The size of microgels in natural coastal seawaters increased by18~25% compared to corresponding dark controls. Within a relatively short time (1 h), the C and N sequestered into the photo-aggregates accounted for 10% and 13% of the bulk particulate C and N, respectively. The N/C ratio of the photo-aggregates was two times higher after sunlight irradiation. Furthermore, we show that the aggregation process was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS). To accommodate for the different organic material in the marine environment, we monitored the particle size in various extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and model biopolymers using flow cytometry, dynamic laser scattering, and scanning electron microscopy. We found that proteins play important roles in light-induced aggregation, which is in contrast to previous views that sunlight can break down DOM and interrupt aggregation. The photo-flocculation process involving organic N provides new insights into DOM assembly, bioavailability, and sedimentation, and thus potentially link the C and N cycles.

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. We present a 3D unstructured-grid hydrodynamic model for the northwestern Gulf of Mexico that utilizes a high-resolution grid for the main estuarine systems along the Texas-Louisiana coast. This model, based on the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM) with hybrid horizontal and vertical grids, is driven by the observed river discharge, reanalysis atmospheric forcing, and open boundary conditions from the global models. The model reproduces well the temporal and spatial variation of observed water level, salinity, temperature, and current velocity both in Galveston Bay and on the shelf. We apply the validated model to examine the remote influence from large rivers, specifically the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers, on the salinity regime along the Texas coast. Numerical experiments reveal that the Mississippi-Atchafalaya discharge could significantly decrease the salinity on the inner shelf along the Texas coast and its influence highly depends on the wind field and the resulting shelf current. Winter wind tends to constrain the Mississippi-Atchafalaya water against the shore, forming a narrow lower-salinity band all the way to the southwestern Texas coast. Under summer wind, the influence of the discharge on salinity is limited to the upper Texas coast while extended offshore. The decrease in salinity at the mouth of Galveston Bay due to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya discharge leads to a decrease in horizontal density gradient, a weakened estuarine circulation inside the bay, a decrease in the salt flux, and a smaller estuarine-ocean exchange. We highlight the flexibility of the model that simulates not only estuarine dynamics and shelf-wide transport but also the interaction between them.

N2  - Silver-impregnated zeolite (AgIZ) has been used for removing radioiodine from contaminated groundwater and nuclear waste streams and the worldwide inventory of such secondary waste is rapidly increasing. The objective of this study was to 1) quantify the effectiveness of two grout waste forms for disposing of the used AgIZ, and 2) determine the I speciation leached from AgIZ encapsulated in grout. A 60-day kinetics batch experiment demonstrated that AgIZ encapsulated in slag-free grout was extremely effective at immobilizing I and Ag, a potential non-radioactive carcinogen. However, AgIZ encapsulated in slag-containing grout, the most common type of grout used for low-level radioactive waste disposal, was entirely ineffective at immobilizing I. While the slag-free grout with AgIZ released only 3.3 μg/L Itotal into the contact solution, the slag-containing grout released 19,269 μg/L Itotal. Based on thermodynamic calculations, the strongly reducing conditions of the slag-containing system (Eh was -392 mV) promoted the reductive dissolution of the AgI, forming Ag0(aq) and releasing iodide (I-) into the aqueous phase. The slag-free grout system was maintained under more oxidizing conditions (Eh was 439 mV) and a minimal amount of I was released from the grout. In both grout systems, the aqueous I, originally added to the AgZ as iodide, was composed primarily of iodide and org-I, and essentially no iodate was detected. More organo-I was detected in the slag-free than the slag-containing grout system because the high redox potential of the former system was more conducive to the formation of oxidized I species, such as I2, which may be intermediates in the covalent bonding of I with organic C in grout. Iodine K-edge XANES analysis indicated that I existed exclusively as silver iodide in both AgIZ-grout samples. Together, these results indicate that subsurface grout disposal of AgIZ waste should be done under oxidizing conditions and that radioiodide released from AgIZ can undergo speciation transformations that have important implications on subsequent mobility and estimated risk.

N2  - Tooth morphology is often used to inform the feeding ecology of an organism as these structures are important to procure and process dietary resources. In sharks, differences in morphology may facilitate the capture and handling of prey with different physical properties. However, few studies have investigated differences in tooth morphology over ontogeny, throughout the jaws of a single species, or among species at multiple tooth positions. Bull (Carcharhinus leucas), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) are coastal predators that exhibit ontogenetic dietary shifts, but differ in their feeding ecologies. This study measured tooth morphology at six positions along the upper and lower jaws of each species using elliptic Fourier analysis to make comparisons within and among species over their ontogeny. Significant ontogenetic differences were detected at four of the six tooth positions in bull sharks, but only the posterior position on the lower jaw appeared to exhibit a functionally relevant shift in morphology. No ontogenetic changes in morphology were detected in blacktip or bonnethead sharks. Intraspecific comparisons found that most tooth positions significantly differed from one another across all species, but heterodonty was greatest in bull sharks. Additionally, interspecific comparisons found differences among all species at each tooth position except between bull and blacktip sharks at two positions. These morphological patterns within and among species may have implications for prey handling efficiency, as well as in providing insight for paleoichthyology studies and reevaluating heterodonty in sharks.

N2  - Habitat shifts that occur during the life cycles of marine fishes influence population connectivity and structure. A generalized additive modeling approach was used to characterize relationships between environmental variables and the relative abundance of red snapper Lutjanus campechanus over unconsolidated substrate on the continental shelf (<150 m) of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at three different life stages: juvenile (age-0, <125 mm FL), sub-adult (age-1-2, 125-300 mm FL), and adult (age-2+, >300 mm FL). Fisheries independent data (2008-2014) were used to develop separate models for both the eastern and western GoM, and final models were used to predict the relative availability of suitable habitat for each life stage across the two regions. Predictor variables included in final models varied by age class and region, with depth, dissolved oxygen, longitude, and distance to artificial structure common to most models. Depth was among the most influential variables in all models, and preferred depth increased with increasing size/age. Regional differences in fish-habitat relationships were also observed, as relative abundance of larger red snapper over unconsolidated substrates was more closely linked to artificial structure in the eastern GoM. The location of predicted high quality habitat for juvenile red snapper was greatest on the inner Texas shelf and a smaller area east of the Mississippi River Delta, suggesting these two areas may represent important nursery grounds for the respective regions. Clear ontogenetic shifts in the spatial distribution of predicted high quality habitat were evident in both the eastern (expansion from west to east with age) and western (shift from inshore to offshore) GoM. Given the unique population dynamics between the eastern and western GoM, improving our understanding of spatial and temporal variability in habitat quality may be important to maintaining connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats, and may enhance recovery and management of red snapper stocks in the GoM.

N2  - Spilled oil treated with Corexit dispersant can cause unintended impacts on marine environment systems including altering marine organic matter dynamics; however, impacts on microgels and marine oil snow (MOS) formation are still debated and remain to be fully understood. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are a major source of marine organic carbon for MOS and microgel formation. EPS initial aggregation plays key roles in the oil degrading process and various biogeochemical reactions. Here we used four types of EPS with water accommodated fraction (WAF), chemically-enhanced WAF (CEWAF) and Corexit, to represent potential situations during oil spills and post-application of Corexit. We found that Corexit alone can inhibit EPS aggregation and disperse pre-existing microgels. CEWAF can enhance EPS aggregation with efficiency by up to 80%-100% and more aggregates accumulated within the air-water interface. Additionally, more hydrophobic EPS aggregates showed high resistance to Corexit dispersion while hydrophilic EPS were more sensitive. Effects of oil spills on marine gel particle formation are primarily determined by chemical characteristics (hydrophobicity and protein content) of the constituent EPS. This study offers unique insights for organic particle dynamics and identifies controlling factors for MOS or gel particles associated with oil spills and Corexit dispersant used.

N2  - Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, natural marine snow interacted with oil and dispersants forming marine oil snow (MOS) that sank from the water column to sediments. Mesocosm simulations demonstrate that Macondo surrogate oil incorporates into MOS and can be isolated, extracted, and analyzed via Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Up to 47% of the FTICR-MS signal from MOS extracts can be attributed to formulas also found in Macondo surrogate oil demonstrating extensive oil incorporation. Additionally, oxygenation patterns for MOS extracts provide evidence for degraded oil compounds. Formulas having similar double bond equivalents but higher oxygen content (MOS CHO: CHO2-9, DBE2-16, MOS CHON: CHO0-7N1, DBE9-18; Macondo CHO: CHO1-4, DBE2-15, CHON: CHO0-3N1, DBE9-21) were found in MOS extracts generating isoabundance distributions similar to those of environmentally aged oil. Such shifts in molecular composition are consistent with the transformation of high DBE oil components, unobservable by FTICR-MS until oxygenation in the mesocosms. Low light conditions and the rapid proliferation of hydrocarbon-degraders observed in parallel studies suggest biological activity as the primary cause of oil degradation. MOS may thus represent an important microenvironment for oil degradation especially during its long transit below the euphotic zone to sediments.

N2  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a series of highly persistent organic pollutants (POPs), are ubiquitous in marine ecosystems. As key primary producers, microalgae are of great importance on evaluating the environmental outcome of PBDEs pollution. In this study, the toxic mechanisms of BDE-47 on the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana were evaluated by measuring multiple physiological processes. Three concentrations of BDE-47 (25, 15 and 5 μg L-1) were used along with two controls (blank: no BDE-47 or DMSO; negative control: only DMSO). Experiments lasted 144 h (6 days), in which the actual BDE-47 concentrations, cell densities, nutrient (nitrate and phosphate) uptake, pigment compositions, photosynthetic physiology, cell morphology and cellular contents (organic carbon and nitrogen) were measured at 12-48 h intervals. The toxic mechanisms of BDE-47 on T. pseudonana cells were evaluated by measuring multiple physiological processes including photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, cellular material synthesis and cell cycle progressions. The cell divisions of T. pseudonana were severely inhibited by the stress of BDE-47, but the photosynthetic parameters were much less declined and recovered earlier than the cell divisions in the same BDE-47 treatments. The unsuppressed uptake rates of nutrients, increased cell volume and cellular contents indicated the cellular material synthesis proceeded normally. Finally, we found that the cell cycle was arrested in G2/M phase under the stress of BDE-47, we thus concluded that the inhibition of cell divisions by BDE-47 was not due to the lack of energy or cellular materials, where the cell cycle arrest happened; this might be the most important toxicological outcome.

N2  - Our understanding of vibrissal function in pinnipeds is poor due to the lack of comparative morphological, neurobiological, and psychophysical performance data. In contrast, the function of terrestrial mammalian vibrissae is better studied. Pinnipeds have the largest vibrissae of all mammals, and phocids may have the most modified vibrissae. The tactile performance for pinniped vibrissae is well known for harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). Harbor seals display at least two types of tactile behavior involving their mystacial vibrissae: a fine discriminatory capability using active touch and hydrodynamic trail following (the ability to detect and follow turbulent trails). This study investigated innervation patterns of harbor seal follicle-sinus complexes (F-SCs) to test the hypothesis that the whiskers used in hydrodynamic trail following possess increased innervation investment compared to other phocids. Therefore, the most lateral vibrissae from five harbor seals were histologically processed so that morphometric measurements and axon counts could be collected. Vibrissae from one harbor seal were immunolabeled with anti-protein gene product (PGP 9.5) to document the pattern of deep vibrissal nerve innervation of the F-SCs. Overall, harbor seals showed an innervation pattern (axons/F-SC and axons/muzzle) similar to other phocids. The ventrolateral vibrissae, involved in hydrodynamic trail following, have greater axon density in harbor seals than harp seals, suggesting harbor seal F-SC innervation patterns could explain their performance at trail following. The combination of microstructural, innervation investment, and behavioral data provides a foundation for functional inference regarding this tactile behavior in harbor seals and also facilitates future comparative work for other pinniped species.

N2  - <jats:p>Renewable energy incorporation in many countries takes different forms. In many developed countries, grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) installations are widely coupled with lucrative Feed-in-Tariffs (FiT). However, conventional grid-tied solutions are not readily viable in many developing countries mainly due to intermittent grids with load shedding and, in some cases, lack of net-metering or FiT. Load shedding refers to an intentional electrical power shutdown by the utility company where electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. This results in a non-continuous availability of the utility grid for many consumers over the course of a day. In this work, the key challenges in the integration of solar energy explicitly in residential power back-up units are reviewed and system hardware level requirements to allow optimized solar PV utilization in such intermittent grid environments are analyzed. Further, based upon the low-cost sensing and real-time monitoring scheme, an online optimization framework enabling efficient solar incorporation in existing systems to achieve minimum grid dependence in intermittent grid environments is also provided. This work is particularly targeted for over 1.5 billion residents of semi-electrified regions in South Asia and Africa with the weak and intermittent grid.</jats:p>

N2  - The diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia is a common component of phytoplankton communities in the Gulf of Mexico and is potentially toxic as some species produce the potent neurotoxin domoic acid. The impact of oil and chemical dispersants on Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and domoic acid production have not yet been studied; preliminary findings from a mesocosm experiment suggest this genus may be particularly resilient. A toxicological study was conducted using a colony of Pseudo-nitzschia sp. isolated from a station off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. The cultures were exposed to a water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil and a diluted chemically enhanced WAF (DCEWAF) which was a mix of oil and dispersant (20:1). Exposure to WAF induced a lag phase but did not inhibit growth rates once in exponential growth. Cultures grown in DCEWAF did not experience a lag phase but had significantly lower growth rates than the Control and WAF cultures. The cellular quota of domoic acid was higher in cultures treated with DCEWAF and WAF relative to their control values, and half of the domoic acid had leaked out of the cells into the surrounding seawater in the DCEWAF cultures while all the domoic acid remained inside the cells in WAF-treated cultures. These results suggest that the presence of oil could lead to toxic blooms, but that the application of dispersant could decrease bioaccumulation of domoic acid through the food web.

N2  - Oysters from a reef in Galveston Bay, Texas, USA, were screened for more virulent clinical strains versus less virulent environmental strains of Vibrio vulnificus using a combination of quantitative PCR assays for the virulence correlating gene (clinical variant, vcgC) and 16S rRNA types A and B (type A = environmental, type B = clinical). The combination of vcgC and 16S rRNA type B loci to determine clinical type strains was suitable, as indicated by the strong correlation (R2 = 0.98; p < 0.001) between these gene counts over time and their relative proportion (up to 93.8% and 94.3%, respectively) to vvhA genes used to quantify all strains of V. vulnificus. A strong seasonal shift of V. vulnificus strain types was observed. Environmental strains (16S rRNA type A) predominated from April to mid-June as salinities increased from 22 to 27 PSU (practical salinity unit) and temperatures rose 20 to 28 °C, with peak gene quantities of 16 812 ± 56 CFU/g. As temperatures increased to ≥30 °C from mid-June to September and salinities rose above 27 PSU, clinical strains (16S rRNA type B; vcgC) predominated with peak quantities 31 868 ± 287 and 32 360 ± 178 CFU/g, respectively.

N2  - Diatoms secrete a significant amount of polysaccharides, which can serve as a critical organic carbon source for bacteria. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill exposed the Gulf of Mexico to substantial amounts of oil that also impacted the phytoplankton community. Increased production of exopolymeric substances was observed after this oil spill. Polysaccharides make up a major fraction of exopolymeric substances; however, their physiological role during an oil spill remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the role of polysaccharides in the growth and physiology of the oil-sensitive diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and how they shape the surrounding bacterial community and its activity in the presence of oil. We found that inhibition of chrysolaminarin synthesis had a negative effect on the growth of T pseudonana and intracellular monosaccharide accumulation, which in turn suppressed photosynthesis by feedback inhibition. In addition, by acting as a carbon reserve, chrysolaminarin helped in the recovery of T pseudonana in the presence of oil. Inhibition of chrysolaminarin synthesis also influenced the bacterial community in the free-living fraction but not in the phycosphere. Exposure to oil alone led to increased abundance of oil-degrading bacterial genera and the activity of exoenzyme lipase. Our data show that chrysolaminarin synthesis plays an important role in the growth and survival of T pseudonana in the presence of oil, and its inhibition can influence the composition and activity of the surrounding bacterial community.

N2  - Phage-host interactions likely play a major role in the composition and functioning of many microbiomes, yet remain poorly understood. Here, we employed single cell genomics to investigate phage-host interactions in a diffuse-flow, low-temperature hydrothermal vent that may be reflective of a broadly distributed biosphere in the subseafloor. We identified putative prophages in 13 of 126 sequenced single amplified genomes (SAGs), with no evidence for lytic infections, which is in stark contrast to findings in the surface ocean. Most were distantly related to known prophages, while their hosts included bacterial phyla Campylobacterota, Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi, Proteobacteria, Lentisphaerae, Spirochaetes, and Thermotogae. Our results suggest the predominance of lysogeny over lytic interaction in diffuse-flow, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, despite the high activity of the dominant Campylobacteria that would favor lytic infections. We show that some of the identified lysogens have co-evolved with their host over geological time scales and that their genes are transcribed in the environment. Functional annotations of lysogeny-related genes suggest involvement in horizontal gene transfer enabling host's protection against toxic metals and antibacterial compounds.

N2  - With a warming climate and a more humid atmosphere, extreme precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently in future. Understanding how coastal systems respond to and recover from such acute events is of fundamental significance for environmental assessment and management. A hydrodynamic model was used to examine the estuarine responses in Galveston Bay to Hurricane Harvey, an extreme precipitation event with a return period of larger than 1000 years. The enormous freshwater input during Harvey caused long-lasting elevated water level, extraordinarily strong along-channel velocity, sharp decreases in salinity, and huge river plumes, all of which were well reproduced by the model. The salinity recovery time (TR) was estimated as a measure of the system resiliency to stormwater input. Over the entire bay, the TR had a mean of two months, but with great variability ranging from less than 10 days near the bay entrance to over three months in the inner part of Trinity Bay and the middle of East Bay. The spatially varying TR was explained by different contributions of exchange flow and tidal pumping to salt flux. At the bay entrance, tidal pumping facilitated by the shelf current was the dominant mechanism for salt influx, while exchange flow and tidal pumping had a comparable contribution to salt influx to Trinity Bay. The spatial pattern of the TR appears consistent with the changes in the phytoplankton community in the bay. A series of numerical experiments with different amounts of stormwater reveals a non-linear relationship between the bay-wide mean TR and the amount of stormwater, with the rate of increase in TR decreasing when stormwater input increases. The present approach using a hydrodynamic model will be able to provide a quick assessment of the environmental pressure from extreme events.

N2  - <jats:p>A study describing the diversity and distribution pattern of the stygobitic fauna in the Ox Bel Ha anchialine cave system adjacent to the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico is presented. A total of 15 species of crustaceans were collected in three surveys at four points situated along a 10.2 km transect perpendicular to the coast line. A freshwater mass dominated throughout the transect with a halocline that appeared progressively deeper, from 10 to 18 m, with increasing distance from the coast. All the recorded species, except for one, occurred throughout the transect with no defined pattern. Abundance and species richness did not vary significantly with distance from the coast, whereas diversity (H’) peaked in the second sampling site at 3.17 km from the coast. As expected, most of the organisms occurred only in the freshwater layer, except for the remipede <jats:italic>Xibalbanustulumensis</jats:italic> (Yager, 1987) that was found always at or below the halocline, and five other species that were found above and below the halocline. In the horizontal scale, species composition and occurrence mixed without a defined pattern, both, for sampling dates and sites. The results show that the analyzed fauna is distributed throughout the 10.2 km transect without showing any defined horizontal zonation pointing to a high connectivity among all sections. Due to the high connectivity within the caves in the area, it is expected that significant variation in species composition and distribution will be found at a larger regional scale.</jats:p>

N2  - American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) mainly inhabit freshwater habitats but can be exposed to a wide range of salinities during storm surges, droughts or from alterations in freshwater flows. Although some salinization events last weeks, others only last a few days. This study assessed changes in the endocrine function of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and steroid hormone production (steroidogenesis) in juvenile alligators exposed to brackish water (12‰) for 7 days. We quantified plasma levels of angiotensin II and the corticosteroids (aldosterone, corticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol). Various progestogens, androgens, and estrogens were further assessed. The protein expression for the RAAS enzymes, renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), was quantified immunohistochemically in kidney and lung tissue, respectively, and histology was performed on kidney, lung and gonad tissues. Finally, blood biochemistry parameters such as electrolyte levels and diagnostic indicators for dehydration, renal, and hepatic function were measured. Corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, Na+, Cl-, total protein, albumin, uric acid, and cholesterol levels were all significantly elevated in alligators exposed to brackish water compared with alligators in freshwater. The levels of 17β-estradiol and estrone were significantly lowered while histology showed alterations in gonad tissue in the brackish water exposed group. In contrast, while there were no effects of exposure on aldosterone levels, angiotensin II was significantly reduced in brackish water exposed alligators. These results correlated with significantly decreased expressions for both renin and ACE in kidney and lung tissue. Overall, this study showed that short-term exposure of alligators to 12‰ brackish water has significant endocrine effects on juvenile alligators.

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. A 3-D unstructured-grid hydrodynamic model for the
northern Gulf of Mexico was developed, with a hybrid s–z vertical grid and
high-resolution horizontal grid for the main estuarine systems along the
Texas–Louisiana coast. This model, based on the Semi-implicit Cross-scale
Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM), is driven by the observed
river discharge, reanalysis atmospheric forcing, and open boundary
conditions from global HYCOM output. The model reproduces the temporal
and spatial variation of observed water level, salinity, temperature, and
current velocity in Galveston Bay and on the shelf. The validated model was
applied to examine the remote influence of neighboring large rivers,
specifically the Mississippi–Atchafalaya River (MAR) system, on
salinity, stratification, vertical mixing, and longshore transport along the
Texas coast. Numerical experiments reveal that the MAR discharge could
significantly decrease the salinity and change the stratification and
vertical mixing on the inner Texas shelf. It would take about 25 and 50 d
for the MAR discharge to reach the mouth of Galveston Bay and Port Aransas,
respectively. The influence of the MAR discharge is sensitive to the wind field.
Winter wind constrains the MAR freshwater to form a narrow lower-salinity
band against the shore from the Mississippi Delta all the way to the
southwestern Texas coast, while summer wind reduces the downcoast longshore
transport significantly, weakening the influence of the MAR discharge on
surface salinity along Texas coast. However, summer wind causes a much
stronger stratification on the Texas shelf, leading to a weaker vertical
mixing. The decrease in salinity of up to 10 psu at the mouth of Galveston
Bay due to the MAR discharge results in a decrease in horizontal density
gradient, a decrease in the salt flux, and a weakened estuarine circulation and
estuarine–ocean exchange. We highlight the flexibility of the model and its
capability to simulate not only estuarine dynamics and shelf-wide transport,
but also the interactions between them.

N2  - Silver (Ag)-based technologies are amongst the most common approaches to removing radioiodine from aqueous waste streams. As a result, a large worldwide inventory of radioactive AgI waste presently exits, which must be stabilized for final disposition. In this work, the efficacy of silver-impregnated granular activated carbon (Ag-GAC) to remove iodide (I-), iodate (IO3-) and organo-iodine (org-I) from cementitious leachate was examined. In addition, cementitious materials containing I-, IO3-, or org-I loaded Ag-GAC were characterized by iodine K-edge XANES and EXAFS to provide insight into iodine stability and speciation in these waste forms. The Ag-GAC was very effective at removing I- and org-I, but ineffective at removing IO3- from slag-free grout leachate under oxic conditions. I- or org-I removal was due to the formation of insoluble AgI(s) or Ag-org-I(s) on the Ag-GAC. When I--loaded Ag-GAC material was cured with slag-free and slag grouts, I- was released from AgI(s) to form a hydrated I- species. Conversely, when org-I loaded Ag-GAC material was cured in the two grout formulations, no change was observed in the iodine speciation, indicating the org-I species remained bound to the Ag. Because little IO3- was bound to the Ag-GAC, it was not detectable in the grout. Thus, grout formulation and I speciation in the waste stream can significantly influence the effectiveness of the long-term disposal of radioiodine associated with Ag-GAC in grout waste forms.

N2  - The relationships of crustaceans and hexapods (Pancrustacea) have been much discussed and partially elucidated following the emergence of phylogenomic data sets. However, major uncertainties still remain regarding the position of iconic taxa such as Branchiopoda, Copepoda, Remipedia, and Cephalocarida, and the sister group relationship of hexapods. We assembled the most taxon-rich phylogenomic pancrustacean data set to date and analyzed it using a variety of methodological approaches. We prioritized low levels of missing data and found that some clades were consistently recovered independently of the analytical approach used. These include, for example, Oligostraca and Altocrustacea. Substantial support was also found for Allotriocarida, with Remipedia as the sister of Hexapoda (i.e., Labiocarida), and Branchiopoda as the sister of Labiocarida, a clade that we name Athalassocarida (="nonmarine shrimps"). Within Allotriocarida, Cephalocarida was found as the sister of Athalassocarida. Finally, moderate support was found for Hexanauplia (Copepoda as sister to Thecostraca) in alliance with Malacostraca. Mapping key crustacean tagmosis patterns and developmental characters across the revised phylogeny suggests that the ancestral pancrustacean was relatively short-bodied, with extreme body elongation and anamorphic development emerging later in pancrustacean evolution.

N2  - Extinction models generally predict that coastal and neritic fauna benefit during sea-level rise (transgression), whereas sea-level retreat (regression) diminishes their suitable habitat area and promotes evolutionary bottlenecks. Sea-level change also impacts terrestrial island biogeography, but it remains a challenge to evidence how sea-level rise impacts aquatic island biogeography, especially in the subterranean realm. Karst subterranean estuaries (KSEs) occur globally on carbonate islands and platforms, and they are populated by globally-dispersed, ancient ecosystems (termed anchialine). Anchialine fauna currently exhibit a disjunct biogeography that cannot be completely explained by plate tectonic-imposed vicariance. Here we provide evidence that anchialine ecosystems can experience evolutionary bottlenecks caused by habitat reduction during transgression events. Marine-adapted anchialine fauna benefit from habitat expansion during transgressions, but fresh- and brackish-adapted fauna must emigrate, evolve to accommodate local habitat changes, or are regionally eliminated. Phanerozoic transgressions relative to long-term changes in subsidence and relief of regional lithology must be considered for explaining biogeography, evolution, local extirpation or complete extinction of anchialine fauna. Despite the omission of this entire category of environments and animals in climate change risk assessments, the results indicate that anchialine fauna on low-lying islands and platforms that depend upon meteoric groundwater are vulnerable to habitat changes caused by 21st century sea-level rise.

N2  - Forecasting the long-term fate of plutonium (Pu) is becoming increasingly important as more worldwide military and nuclear-power waste is being generated. Nagasaki sediments containing bomb-derived Pu that was deposited in 1945 provided a unique opportunity to explore the long-term geochemical behavior of Pu. Through a combination of selective extractions and molecular characterization via electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICRMS), we determined that 55 ± 3% of the bomb-derived 239,240Pu was preferentially associated with more persistent organic matter compounds in Nagasaki sediments, particularly those natural organic matter (NOM) stabilized by Fe oxides (NOMFe-oxide). Other organic matter compounds served as a secondary sink of these bomb-derived 239,240Pu (31 ± 2% on average), and <20% of the 239,240Pu was immobilized by inorganic mineral particles. In a narrow, 239,240Pu-enriched layer of only 9-cm depth (total core depth was 600 cm), N-containing carboxyl aliphatic and/or alicyclic molecules (CCAM) in NOMFe-oxide and other NOM fractions immobilized the majority of 239,240Pu. Among the cluster of N-containing CCAM moieties, hydroxamate siderophores, the strongest known Pu chelators in nature, were further detected in these "aged" Nagasaki bomb residue-containing sediments. While present long-term disposal and environmental remediation modeling assume that solubility limits and sorption to mineral surfaces control Pu subsurface mobility, our observations suggest that NOM, which is present in essentially all subsurface systems, undoubtedly plays an important role in sequestrering Pu. Ignoring the role of NOM in controlling Pu fate and transport is not justified in most environmental systems.

N2  - Vibrissae or follicle-sinus complexes (F-SCs) are highly developed mammalian sensory structures. These blood-filled sinuses are richly innervated and possess novel mechanoreceptors. Although much is known regarding the function of F-SCs in terrestrial mammals, much less is known regarding marine carnivores such as pinnipeds. Pinnipeds possess the largest, most highly innervated vibrissae of any mammal. One such pinniped is the California sea lion, which are generalist marine predators that rely heavily upon tactile discrimination capabilities. Psychophysical studies demonstrate that haptic tactile discrimination using F-SCs is exceptionally sensitive. However, our knowledge of the structure and function of F-SCs in otariids is limited. Our objectives were to investigate the innervation and microstructure of F-SCs across the mystacial vibrissal field and infer function from haptic performance studies in California sea lions. Innervation and microstructure of vibrissae differed considerably compared to similar data available for phocids. Total innervation of mystacial vibrissae was estimated to be 86,042 axons. Investigations of innervation density and investment of microvibrissae versus macrovibrissae demonstrated a significantly increased axon density per F-SC in medial microvibrissal regions compared to lateral macrovibrissae, which supports psychophysical data and somatotopic organization of the central nervous system involved with tactile discrimination capability. Innervation increased from medial microvibrissae (705 ± 125 axons/F-SC) to lateral macrovibrissae (1,447 ± 154) as well as from dorsal (541 ± 60) to ventral (1,493 ± 327) vibrissal regions. These data provide a more complete picture of the sensory ecology of this important aquatic mammalian lineage; the specialization of peripheral sensory structures, central nervous structures with demonstrated enhanced haptic capabilities behaviorally has likely led to the ecological success of California sea lions.

TV survived inside the brood without the female for at least 14 days and some larvae hatched and died during settling. Some of these larvae were abnormal, with two rounded protuberances in the two ends. Mortality was high. Fungi and protozoans appeared in the dishes and probably partially induced the production of thicker mucus in the brood tubes, delay in metamorphosis, juvenile mortality, worm length and failure in coupling. Size and duration of the developmental stages were distinctly different from the other putative lecithotrophic species of the complex. These differences and other characteristics of each species discard the possibility that they belong to a previously described species. Our results are applicable to future ecological, morphological and molecular studies of each species, habitat and phylogenetics.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>The air–sea heat fluxes in marginal seas and under extreme weather conditions constitute an essential source for energy transport and mixing dynamics. To reproduce these effects in numerical models, we need a better understanding of these fluxes. In response to this demand, we undertook a study to examine the surface heat fluxes in the Arabian Gulf (2013 to 2014) and Red Sea (2008 to 2010)—the two salty Indian Ocean marginal seas. We use high-quality buoy observations from offshore meteorological stations and data from two reanalysis products, the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and ERA5, the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalyses of global climate. Comparison of the reanalyses with the in situ-derived fluxes shows that both products underestimate the net heat fluxes in the Gulf and the Red Sea, with biases up to −45 W/m     2     in MERRA2. The reanalyses reproduce relatively well the seasonal variability in the two regions and the effects of wind events on air–sea fluxes. The results suggest that when forcing numerical models, ERA5 might provide a preferable dataset of surface heat fluxes for the Arabian Gulf while for the Red Sea the MERRA2 seems preferable.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>Nine years after the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill (20 April–15 July 2010), the recovery of primary productivity at the ocean surface remains to be investigated. Here, we used the normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer as an indicator of chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> concentration (Chl <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>). First, from the spatiotemporal variations of nFLH between 2001 and 2017, a reduction of nFLH after the DwH oil spill was observed (for a relatively long period, from 2011 to 2014). Second, a stepwise multiple regression model was used to examine which of the following environmental factors could explain the annual variations in nFLH: river discharge, total nitrogen load, total phosphorus load, photosynthetically available radiation, sea surface temperature and wind speed. Results show that river discharge, sea surface temperature and wind speed are the primary factors that regulated the annual nFLH variations in the DwH area during the pre-spill years. In contrast, this same model could not explain the reduction of nFLH for the four years after the DwH oil spill. After 2015, nFLH appears to have resumed to the pre-spill concentrations. Here we suggest that the nFLH reduction between 2011 and 2014 could have originated from the DwH oil spill, although the exact mechanism is yet to be determined.</jats:p>

N2  - Flood-related losses in the United States are increasing despite large-scale mitigation efforts. To offset the rising cost of floods, the US Congress passed legislation in 2014 that will augment insurance premiums to make the National Flood Insurance Program more actuarially sound. Consequently, there is interest in lowering flood-related costs to the homeowner, both in terms of premiums and damage. This study addresses the issue by integrating premium savings and damages avoided based on several mitigation scenarios. Specifically, it examines how much policyholders within a watershed near Houston, Texas, could have saved between 1999 and 2009 had their communities introduced specific avoidance-based mitigation activities. The results indicate that homeowners and communities can offset premium rises and a majority of the damage suffered through marginal expansions of such initiatives. However, the costs associated with their implementation could counter some of these savings, and hence they need to be considered in future work.

N2  - Climate change impacts physical and chemical properties of the oceans, and these changes affect the ecology of marine organisms. One important ecological consequence of climate change is the distribution shift of marine species toward higher latitudes. Here, the prevalence of nearly 150 species of fish and invertebrates were investigated to find changes in their distributions over 35 years along a subtropical coast within the Gulf of Mexico. Our results show that 90 species increased their occupancy probability, while 33 decreased (remaining species neither increase or decrease), and the ranges of many species expanded. Using rarefaction analysis, which allows for the estimation of species diversity, we show that species diversity has increased across the coast of Texas. Climate-mediated environmental variables are related to the changes in the occupancy probability, suggesting the expansion of tropical species into the region is increasing diversity.

N2  - Exposure to natural disasters like hurricanes negatively impacts the mental and physical health of populations, and evacuation is an important step taken to prevent these adverse health events. This study uses data from a large representative sample of U.S. Gulf Coast residents to explore the determinants of hurricane evacuation. In December 2017, data were collected from 3030 residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast, including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida-2557 of whom reported being impacted during the 2017 hurricane season. Bivariate analyses were conducted using prevalence differences and tested for statistical significance with chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with hurricane evacuation. One-third of the respondents (919 of 2557; 35.9%) evacuated from a hurricane that impacted the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2017. The determinants of hurricane evacuation in this population were: residing in a mobile home, higher perception of storm surge risk, higher perception of wind risk, self-sufficiency, carrying flood insurance, and reliance on media and family for evacuation decisions. These findings may be relevant for reducing the adverse health effects of hurricanes by improving emergency planning and evacuation in this highly vulnerable region.

N2  - Iodine-129 is one of three key risk drivers at several US Department of Energy waste management sites. Natural organic matter (NOM) is thought to play important roles in the immobilization of aqueous iodide (I-) and iodate (IO3-) in the environment, but molecular interactions between NOM and iodine species are poorly understood. In this work, we investigated iodine and carbon speciation in three humic acid (HA)-I systems using I K-edge XANES and EXAFS and C K-edge XANES spectroscopy: (1) I- in the presence of laccase (an oxidase enzyme) and a mediator, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) in a pH 4 buffer, (2) I- in the presence of lactoperoxidase (LPO) and H2O2 in a pH 7 buffer, and (3) IO3- in a pH 3 groundwater. Both oxidase and peroxidase systems could oxidize I- to I2 or hypoiodide (HOI) leading to organo-I formation. However, the laccase-ABTS mediator was the most effective and enhanced I- uptake by HA up to 13.5 mg/g, compared to 1.9 mg/g for the LPO-H2O2. IO3- was abiotically reduced to I2 or HOI leading to an organo-I formation. Pathways for HA iodination include covalent modification of aromatic-type rings by I2 / HOI or iodine incorporation into newly formed benzoquinone species arising from the oxidation of phenolic C species. This study improves our molecular-level understanding of NOM-iodine interactions and stresses the important role that mediators may play in the enzymatic reactions between iodine and NOM.

N2  - The idea that 'everything is everywhere, but the environment selects' has been seminal in microbial biogeography, and marine phytoplankton is one of the prototypical groups used to illustrate this. The typical argument has been that phytoplankton is ubiquitous, but that distinct assemblages form under environmental selection. It is well established that phytoplankton assemblages vary considerably between coastal ecosystems. However, the relative roles of compartmentalization of regional seas and site-specific environmental conditions in shaping assemblage structures have not been specifically examined. We collected data from coastal embayments that fall within two different water compartments within the same regional sea and are characterized by highly localized environmental pressures. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) and asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) models to partition the effects that spatial structures, environmental conditions and their overlap had on the variation in assemblage composition. Our models explained a high percentage of variation in assemblage composition (59-65%) and showed that spatial structure consistent with marine compartmentalization played a more important role than local environmental conditions. At least during the study period, surface currents connecting sites within the two compartments failed to generate sufficient dispersal to offset the impact of differences due to compartmentalization. In other words, our findings suggest that, even for a prototypical cosmopolitan group, everything is not everywhere.

N2  - <jats:p>Renewable energy sources (RESs) are the replacement of fast depleting, environment polluting, costly, and unsustainable fossil fuels. RESs themselves have various issues such as variable supply towards the load during different periods, and mostly they are available at distant locations from load centers. This paper inspects forecasting techniques, employed to predict the RESs availability during different periods and considers the dispatch mechanisms for the supply, extracted from these resources. Firstly, we analyze the application of stochastic distributions especially the Weibull distribution (WD), for forecasting both wind and PV power potential, with and without incorporating neural networks (NN). Secondly, a review of the optimal economic dispatch (OED) of RES using particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented. The reviewed techniques will be of great significance for system operators that require to gauge and pre-plan flexibility competence for their power systems to ensure practical and economical operation under high penetration of RESs.</jats:p>

N2  - Large amounts of oil containing mucous-like marine snow formed in surface waters adjacent to the Deepwater Horizon spill that was implicated in oil delivery to the seafloor. However, whether chemical dispersants that were used increased or decreased the oil incorporation and sedimentation efficiency, and how exopolymeric substances (EPS) are involved in this process remains unresolved. To investigate the microbial responses to oil and dispersants in different oceanic settings, indicated by EPS production, petro- and non-petro carbon sedimentation, four mesocosm (M) experiments were conducted: 1) nearshore seawater with a natural microbial consortia (M2); 2) offshore seawater with f/20 nutrients (M3); 3) coastal seawater with f/20 nutrients (M4); 4) nearshore seawater with a natural microbial consortia for a longer duration (M5). Four treatments were conducted in M2, M3 and M4 whereas only three in M5: 1) a water accommodated fraction of oil (WAF), 2) a chemically-enhanced WAF prepared with Corexit (CEWAF, not in M5), 3) a 10-fold diluted CEWAF (DCEWAF); and 4) controls. Overall, oil and dispersants input, nutrient and microbial biomass addition enhanced EPS production. Dispersant addition tended to induce the production of EPS with higher protein/carbohydrate (P/C) ratios, irrespective of oceanic regions. EPS produced in M4 was generally more hydrophobic than that produced in M3. The P/C ratio of EPS in both the aggregate and the colloidal fraction was a key factor that regulated oil contribution to sinking aggregates, based on the close correlation with %petro-carbon in these fractions. In the short term (4-5 days), both the petro and non-petro carbon sedimentation efficiencies showed decreasing trends when oil/dispersants were present. In comparison, in the longer-term (16 days), petro-carbon sedimentation efficiency was less influenced by dispersants, possibly due to biological and physicochemical changes of the components of the oil-EPS-mineral phase system, which cooperatively controlled the sinking velocities of the aggregates.

N2  - Medusae of Turritopsis dohrnii undergo reverse development in response to physical damage, adverse environmental conditions, or aging. Senescent, weakened or damaged medusae transform into a cluster of poorly differentiated cells (known as the cyst stage), which metamorphose back into a preceding life cycle stage, the polyp. During the metamorphosis, cell transdifferentiation occurs. The cyst represents the intermediate stage between a reverting medusa and a healthy polyp, during which cell transdifferentiation and tissue reorganization take place. Here we characterize and compare the transcriptomes of the polyp and newborn medusa stages of T. dohrnii with that of the cyst, to identify biological networks potentially involved in the reverse development and transdifferentiation processes. The polyp, medusa and cyst of T. dohrnii were sequenced through Illumina RNA-sequencing and assembled using a de novo approach, resulting in 92,569, 74,639 and 86,373 contigs, respectively. The transcriptomes were annotated and comparative analyses among the stages identified biological networks that were significantly over-and under-expressed in the cyst as compared to the polyp and medusa stages. Biological processes that occur at the cyst stage such as telomerase activity, regulation of transposable elements and DNA repair systems, and suppression of cell signaling pathways, mitotic cell division and cellular differentiation and development may be involved in T. dohrnii's reverse development and transdifferentiation. Our results are the first attempt to understand T. dohrnii's life-cycle reversal at the genetic level, and indicate possible avenues of future research on developmental strategies, cell transdifferentiation, and aging using T. dohrnii as a non-traditional in vivo system.

N2  - Despite overall global declines, mangroves are expanding into and within many subtropical wetlands, leading to heterogeneous cover of marsh-mangrove coastal vegetation communities near the poleward edge of mangroves' ranges. Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 × 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 × 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4°C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.

N2  - Despite numerous approaches to the resolution of euarthropod phylogeny, mainly based on modern sequence information and traditional external morphology, the resulting hypotheses are often contradictory and leave many questions about euarthropod evolution unanswered. The comparison of developmental and structural aspects of the nervous system has shown to be a valuable contribution to the assessment of current phylogenetic hypotheses. One promising approach for the generation of new character sets is the morphology of transmitter systems and the discovery of individually identifiable neurons, which allow phylogenetic comparisons on the single cell level. In this context, the serotonin transmitter system has been investigated to a considerable degree. Studies to date have yielded important stimuli to our understanding of euarthropod relationships and the evolution of their nervous systems. However, data on other transmitter systems remain fragmented, and their value with respect to phylogenetic questions remains speculative. The biogenic amine histamine is a promising transmitter; a substantial amount of data has been reported in the literature and the homology of some histaminergic neurons has been suggested. Here, we present a comprehensive review of histaminergic neurons in the ventral nerve cord of Euarthropoda. Using immunocytochemical labeling of histamine combined with confocal laser-scanning microscopy, we investigated the transmitter system in phylogenetically relevant taxa, such as Zygentoma, Remipedia, Diplopoda, and Arachnida. By reconstructing ground patterns, we evaluated the significance of this specific character set for euarthropod phylogeny. With this approach, we identified a set of neurons, which can be considered homologous within the respective major taxon. In conclusion, the histaminergic system contains useful information for our understanding of euarthropod phylogeny, supporting the proposed clades Tetraconata and Mandibulata. Furthermore, this character set has considerable potential to help resolve relationships within the major clades at a deeper level of taxonomy, due to the considerable variability in neurite morphology.

N2  - Phloem-feeding planthoppers of the genus Prokelisia rank among the most abundant and ecologically important browsers of coastal saltmarsh grasses of eastern North America and the Caribbean. Along the Spartina marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico, the sympatric species P. marginata and P. dolus are the most abundant, but are difficult to distinguish from each other based solely on morphology. This study seeks to design a molecular assay based on High Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) as a fast, cost-effective alternative to differentiate these species. A 450 base pairs (bp) segment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was amplified and sequenced for representative samples of both species, and a short amplicon (SA) HRMA was designed based on the presence of fixed nucleotide differences between species found along a 60 bp segment of COI. The unambiguous identification of individual specimens of P. marginata or P. dolus was possible due to easily discernable differences in the melting temperatures of the two species along this mini barcode. This assay may prove useful for future genetic studies involving these species by preventing the overestimation of genetic diversity via inclusion of conspecifics, and in ecological studies by improving data on the effects of individual species of Prokelisia.

N2  - Understanding the stress responses of sharks to recreational catch and release fishing has important management and conservation implications. The blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus is a popular recreational species targeted throughout the western, central and eastern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) yet it is unclear what levels of physiological stress result from catch-release fishing practices with hook and line gear and if the stress levels result in post-release mortality. This study correlates physiological response to stress through blood chemistry analysis and examines post-release behaviour of adult blacktip sharks caught to determine post-release mortality rates. Release behaviour was determined by pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags that record temperature, depth and light level data. To quantify physiological stress levels, blood samples were collected from 52 blacktip sharks and a suite of metabolic and osmotic markers were measured. Thirty-six of those blacktip sharks were also outfitted with a PSAT tag yielding time-at-large from 3 to 180 days. Of the 36 tags, 22 (61%) provided sufficient data to confirm post-release fate and 11 (31%) were recovered providing high-resolution data. Tag data suggests a post-release morality rate of 22.7% (95% confidence interval 7.8-45.4%), with mortality occurring within minutes (immediate mortality) to over 12 h post-release (delayed mortality). Compared to survivors, immediate mortalities exhibited significantly higher lactate (median 2.8 mmol/Lsurvivor vs 5.9 mmol/Limmediate mortality) and significantly lower hematocrit (median 24.4% survivor vs 14% immediate mortality) levels, but no difference was detected between survivors and delayed mortalities. Higher mortality in the western (30%) compared to the central (20%) Gulf may be due to shark handling. All PSATs from mortalities (N = 5) were recovered, and archived data revealed evidence of tag ingestion by predators. Results suggest reduced fight time, decreased handling time and limited air exposure provide blacktip sharks the best survival chances after release by recreational anglers.

The life histories of estuarine species are often adapted to the environmental variability they experience. However, estuaries are increasingly vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic changes, necessitating an understanding of how shifting conditions affect the survival, behaviour and population structure of estuarine-dependent animals. In this study we used data from fisheries-independent surveys collected across six estuaries with variable salinity regimes in Texas, USA, from 1975 to 2016 to investigate the role sources of freshwater inflow play in shaping juvenile bull shark Carcharhinus leucas size structure. High frequencies of co-occurrence with similarly sized conspecifics (59% of capture events) suggest bull sharks segregated within Texan estuaries based on body size. Bull shark sizes increased with distance to the nearest source of freshwater inflow, although effect sizes were small and access to freshwater habitats may be more important in shaping size-dependent distribution patterns. River mouths were disproportionately used by smaller juveniles (&amp;lt;90-cm total length, TL) and avoided by larger juveniles (&amp;gt;135cm TL). However, the use of river mouths decreased in estuaries characterised by limited freshwater inflow and greater variability in salinities at river mouths, highlighting geographic differences in the functions these habitats provide as potential environmental and predator refugia. Young-of-the-year (i.e. age-0) sharks also increased their use of river mouths throughout the 40-year study period, revealing the growing importance of river mouths as potential nursery habitats.

A simulation model for nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria was formulated to predict population and nutrient dynamics in water quality studies. The model tracks population biomasses of nitrogen and phosphorus, which potentially limit population growth. Lack of intracellular nitrogen cues the differentiation of specialised heterocysts for nitrogen fixation. Ecoevolutionary analysis presented here predicts that natural selection optimises heterocyst differentiation in relation to external supplies of nitrogen and phosphorus. Modelling the production of N-rich toxins (e.g. anatoxins, saxitoxins) suggests that both total biomass and the biomass N:P ratio can predict concentrations of toxins. The results suggest hypotheses that major taxa of nitrogen-fixing, nuisance cyanobacteria are differentially adapted to varying nitrogen and phosphorus supplies, and that biomass stoichiometry is related to toxins production in this major group of harmful algae. This approach can be extended into models of community and ecosystem dynamics to explore implications of nitrogen fixation for cyanobacterial biomass and toxins production.

N2  - <jats:p>This paper investigates habitat-fisheries interaction between two important resources in the Chesapeake Bay: blue crabs and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). A habitat can be essential to a species (the species is driven to extinction without it), facultative (more habitat means more of the species, but species can exist at some level without any of the habitat) or irrelevant (more habitat is not associated with more of the species). An empirical bioeconomic model that allows for all three possible relationships was estimated and two alternative approaches were used to test whether SAV matters for the crab stock. Our results indicate that a model that incorrectly assumes that habitat is essential to a species can result in model misspecification and biased estimates of the impact of habitat on species productivity. Using a model that assumes an essential relationship, we find that SAV has a significant positive impact on blue crab productivity (p&lt;0.001). However, in a more general model, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that SAV is irrelevant for crabs in the Bay (p&gt;0.05).</jats:p>

N2  - Despite efforts to mitigate the adverse impacts of flooding across the United States, losses from both acute and chronic events continue to rise, particularly in low-lying coastal areas. From 1999 to 2009 the U.S. suffered approximately $33.5 billion in insured flood losses alone. Counties and parishes along the Gulf of Mexico coastline reported almost $21.5 billion of this total. These property damage estimates help solidify what has been generally understood for years: that floods pose a major risk to communities and with increasing development in coastal areas the problem is growing worse.

Recent advances in phytoplankton modelling have used species-rich, self-organising assemblages. These models have shown that phytoplankton with complementary life-history traits related to resource exploitation assemble into stable states of lumpy coexistence when resources fluctuate where species’ niches occur in clusters along resource gradients. They have also shown that a high degree of competitive dissimilarity between clusters arises, and that this relates to the incidence of monospecific blooms of allelochemical-producing taxa, i.e. some harmful algal bloom (HAB) species. These findings further suggest that the mode (sudden v. gradual changes) under which limiting resources fluctuate plays an important role in determining the emergent properties of the assemblage. For example, productivity, biodiversity and the number of species clusters (and, therefore, resistance to HABs) are all enhanced when switches in resource supplies are gradual, compared with when they are sudden. These theoretical findings, as well as others discussed herein, are of particular interest in watersheds where human activities, such as dam construction, have the capacity to dramatically alter natural-resource fluctuation patterns.

N2  - <jats:p>Climate change is altering agricultural production and ecosystems around the world. Future projections indicate that additional change is expected in the coming decades, forcing individuals and communities to respond and adapt. Current research efforts typically examine climate change effects and possible adaptations but fail to integrate agriculture and ecosystems. This failure to jointly consider these systems and associated externalities may underestimate climate change impacts or cause adaptation implementation surprises, such as causing adaptation status of some groups or ecosystems to be worsened. This work describes and motivates reasons why ecosystems and agriculture adaptation require an integrated analytical approach. Synthesis of current literature and examples from Texas are used to explain concepts and current challenges. Texas is chosen because of its high agricultural output that is produced in close interrelationship with the surrounding semi-arid ecosystem. We conclude that future effect and adaptation analyses would be wise to jointly consider ecosystems and agriculture. Existing paradigms and useful methodology can be transplanted from the sustainable agriculture and ecosystem service literature to explore alternatives for climate adaptation and incentivization of private agriculturalists and consumers. Researchers are encouraged to adopt integrated modeling as a means to avoid implementation challenges and surprises when formulating and implementing adaptation.</jats:p>

N2  - Food insecurity prevalence among disaster-affected households has been found to be higher than state prevalence in non-disaster times. This study applies a socio-ecological model of post-disaster food insecurity to a nested quota sample (n = 1002) recruited for a web survey from 41 Texas counties affected by Hurricane Harvey 12-15 months post-event. This analysis identifies risk and protective factors for food insecurity. Chi-square analysis was used to examine independent associations between individual, household, and social factors with food insecurity. A multivariate logistic model was fitted and adjusted odds ratios are reported. Economic instability (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.43; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.73, 3.41), relocation due to Hurricane Harvey (OR 1.89; CI 1.15, 3.09), major home damage (OR 2.11; CI 1.12, 3.98), non-white race - black (OR 1.79; CI 1.01, 3.18), Hispanic (OR 1.67; CI 1.09, 2.54), other race (OR 4.39; CI 1.96, 9.82) - and community-based organization assistance (1.99; 1.11, 3.58) were risk factors while older age (45-64 years: 0.49; 0.32, 0.73; 65+ years 0.40; 0.22, 0.75), better physical health (0.46; 0.29, 0.71), better mental health (0.46; 0.32, 0.67), and high social support (0.37; 0.25, 0.55) were protective against food insecurity. Disaster policies and programs should address the disproportionate burden on households that relocate or have health conditions. Fostering social support networks, especially among relocated populations, may improve disaster health outcomes.

N2  - Natal origin of subadult (age-1) Pacific bluefin tuna (PBT, Thunnus orientalis) from the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) was determined using natural tracers in ear stones (otoliths). Age-0 PBT collected from the two known spawning areas in the western Pacific Ocean (East China Sea, Sea of Japan) were used to establish baseline signatures from otolith cores over 4 years (2014-2017) based on a suite of trace elements (Li, Mg, Mn, Sr, Zn and Ba). Distinct chemical signatures existed in the otolith cores of age-0 PBT collected from the two spawning areas, with overall classification accuracy ranging 73-93% by year. Subadult PBT collected in the CCLME over the following 4 years (2015-2018) were then age-class matched to baselines using mixed-stock analysis. Natal origin of trans-Pacific migrants in the CCLME ranged 43-78% from the East China Sea and 22-57% from the Sea of Japan, highlighting the importance of both spawning areas for PBT in the CCLME. This study provides the first estimates on the natal origin of subadult PBT in this ecosystem using otolith chemistry and expands upon the application of these natural tracers for population connectivity studies for this species.

N2  - Increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events under the future warming climate makes the storm-related pollutant release more and more threatening to coastal ecosystems. Hurricane Harvey, a 1000-year extreme precipitation event, caused massive pollutant release from the Houston metropolitan area to the adjacent Galveston Bay. 0.57 × 106 tons of raw sewage and 22,000 barrels of oil, refined fuels and chemicals were reportly released during Harvey, which would likely deteriorate the water quality and damage the coastal ecosystem. Using a Lagrangian particle-tracking method coupled with a validated 3D hydrodynamic model, we examined the retention, pathway, and fate of the released pollutants. A new timescale, local exposure time (LET), is introduced to quantitatively evaluate the spatially varying susceptibility inside the bay and over the shelf, with a larger LET indicating the region is more susceptible to the released pollutants. We found LET inside the bay is at least one order of magnitude larger for post-storm release than storm release due to a quick recovery in the system's flushing. More than 90% of pollutants released during the storm exited the bay within two days, while those released after the storm could stay inside the bay for up to three months. This implies that post-storm release is potentially more damaging to water quality and ecosystem health. Our results suggest that not only the amount of total pollutant load but also the release timing should be considered when assessing a storm's environmental and ecological influence, because there could be large amounts of pollutants steadily and slowly discharged after storm through groundwater, sewage systems, and reservoirs.

N2  - There is clear overlap in interests and influences for the fields of Atlantic, environmental, and southern history, but scholarship in them has often advanced on parallel tracks. This anthology places itself at the intersection, pushing for a new confluence. Editors Thomas Blake Earle and D. Andrew Johnson provide a lucid introduction to this collection of essays that brings these disciplines together. With this volume, historians explore crucial insights into a self-consciously Atlantic environmental history of the American South, touching on such topics as ideas about slavery, gender, climate, "colonial ecological revolution," manipulation of the landscape, infrastructure, resources, and exploitation.

By centering this project on a region, the American South-defined as the southeastern reaches of North America and the Caribbean- the authors interrogate how European colonizers, Native Americans, and Africans interacted in and with the (sub)tropics, a place foreign to Europeans.

Challenging the concepts of "Atlantic" and "southern" and their intersection with "environments" is a discipline-defining strategy at the leading edge of emerging scholarship. Taken collectively, this book should encourage more readers to reimagine this region, its time periods, climate(s), and ecocultural networks.

N2  - The pervasive presence of plastic waste in the aquatic environment is widely viewed as one of the most serious environmental challenges for current and future generations. Microplastics ultimately degrade into nano and smaller-sizes. In turn, their biological and ecological impacts become more complicated and ambiguous. Nano-plastic particles travel from freshwater systems to estuarine and oceanic regions, during which they can interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM) to form microgels. Microgel formation is ubiquitous in aquatic systems, serving as a shunt between DOM and particulate organic matter (POM), as well as playing key roles in particle aggregation/sedimentation and pollutant transport. Currently the influences and mechanisms of the aggregation behavior and environmental fate of nano-plastics in different aquatic environments is poorly understood. Here, we report that 25 nm polystyrene nano-particles in lake and river water can promote POM (microgel) formation and accelerate the DOM-POM transition. We also adjusted various salinities of water samples to simulate scenarios based on plastic transport in waters flowing from rivers to seas. The results indicate polystyrene nanoparticles can interact with organic matter to form large organic particles, which may undergo further settling in response to specific salinity levels. Polystyrene-induced microgel formation appears to involve the hydrophobic interactions between plastics and DOM. Our data provides much needed information for modeling and understanding the retention and sedimentation of nano-plastics. We show that nano-plastics alter the DOM-POM shunt to cause unanticipated perturbations in the functionality of aquatic ecosystems.

N2  - <jats:p>Due to the impediments of voltage source inverter and current source inverter, Z-Source Inverter (ZSI) has become notorious for better power quality in low and medium power applications. Several modifications are proposed for impedance source in the form of Quasi Z-Source Inverter (QZSI) and Neutral Point Clamped Z-Source Inverter (NPCZSI). However, due to the discontinuity of the source current, NPCZSI is not suitable for some applications, i.e., fuel cell, UPS, and hybrid electric vehicles. Although in later advancements, source current becomes continuous in multilevel QZSI, low voltage gain, higher shoot-through duty ratio, lesser availability of modulation index, and higher voltage stress across switches are still an obstacle in NPCZSI. In this research work, a three-level high voltage gain Neutral Point Clamped Inverter (NPCI) that gives three-level AC output in a single stage, is proposed to boost up the DC voltage at the desired level. At the same time, it detains all the merits of previous topologies of three-level NPCZSI/QZSI. Simulations have been done in the MATLAB/Simulink environment to show the effectiveness of the proposed inverter topology.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Adopting effective flood mitigation practices for repetitive flood events in the United States continues to play a prominent role in preventing future damage and fostering resilience to residential flooding. Two common mitigation practices for reducing residential flood risk consist of raising an existing structure to or above base flood elevation (BFE) and acquiring chronically damaged properties in flood prone areas and restoring them back to serve their natural functions as green open spaces. However, due to data accuracy limitations, decision makers are faced with the challenge of identifying the financially optimal approach to implementing mitigation measures. We address this problem through the following research questions: What does the optimal allocation of flood mitigation resources look like under data uncertainty, and what are the optimal methods to combining mitigation measures with consideration for the best economic benefits? Using a robust decision making (RDM) approach, the effects of uncertainty in property values, construction and demolition costs, and policy implementation options such as structure selection and budget allocation were measured. Our results indicate that the amount budgeted for mitigation and how those funds are allocated directly influence the selection of the most economically viable mitigation practices. Our research also contributes to the growing need for evaluating specific flood mitigation strategies.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>An increase in demand for renewable energy resources, energy storage technologies, and electric vehicles requires high-power level DC-DC converters. The DC-DC converter that is suitable for high-power conversion applications (i.e., resonant, full-bridge or the dual-active bridge) requires magnetic transformer coupling between input and output stage. However, transformer design in these converters remains a challenging problem, with several non-linear scaling issues that need to be simultaneously optimized to reduce losses and maintain acceptable performance. In this paper, a new transformer-less high step-up boost converter with a charge pump capacitorand capacitor-inductor-diode CLD cell is proposed using dynamic modeling. The experimental and simulation results of the proposed converter are carried out in a laboratory and through Matlab Simulink, where 10 V is given as an input voltage, and at the output, 100 V achieved in the proposed converter. A comparative analysis of the proposed converter has also been done with a conventional quadratic converter that has similar parameters. The results suggest that the proposed converter can obtain high voltage gain without operating at the maximum duty cycle and is more efficient than the conventional converter.</jats:p>

N2  - Microbial heterotopic metabolism in the ocean is fueled by a supply of essential nutrients acquired via exoenzymes catalyzing depolymerization of high-molecular-weight compounds. Although the rates of activity for a variety of exoenzymes across various marine environments are well established, the factors regulating the production of these exoenzymes, and to some extent their correlation with microbial community composition, are less known. This study focuses on addressing these challenges using a mesocosm experiment that compared a natural seawater microbial community (control) and exposed (to oil) treatment. Exoenzyme activities for β-glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and lipase were significantly correlated with dissolved nutrient concentrations. We measured correlations between carbon- and nitrogen-acquiring enzymes (β-glucosidase/lipase versus LAP) and found that the correlation of carbon-acquiring enzymes varies with the chemical nature of the available primary carbon source. Notably, a strong correlation between particulate organic carbon and β-glucosidase activity demonstrates their polysaccharide depolymerization in providing the carbon for microbial growth. Last, we show that exoenzyme activity patterns are not necessarily correlated with prokaryotic community composition, suggesting a redundancy of exoenzyme functions among the marine microbial community and substrate availability. This study provides foundational work for linking exoenzyme function with dissolved organic substrate and downstream processes in marine systems.IMPORTANCE Microbes release exoenzymes into the environment to break down complex organic matter and nutrients into simpler forms that can be assimilated and utilized, thereby addressing their cellular carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus requirements. Despite its importance, the factors associated with the synthesis of exoenzymes are not clearly defined, especially for the marine environment. Here, we found that exoenzymes associated with nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition were strongly correlated with inorganic nutrient levels, while those associated with carbon acquisition depended on the type of organic carbon available. We also show a linear relationship between carbon- and nitrogen-acquiring exoenzymes and a strong correlation between microbial biomass and exoenzymes, highlighting their significance to microbial productivity. Last, we show that changes in microbial community composition are not strongly associated with changes in exoenzyme activity profiles, a finding which reveals a redundancy of exoenzyme activity functions among microbial community. These findings advance our understanding of previously unknown factors associated with exoenzyme production in the marine environment.

N2  - A plausible biocontrol strategy for the eradication of invasive species involves augmenting wild populations with genetically modified supermales. Supermales contain double YY chromosomes. When they are augmented into a wild population, destabilization and eventual extinction occurs over time due to a strongly skewed gender ratio towards males. Here, we employ a mathematical model that considers an Allee effect, but we have discovered through simulation that the presence of supermales leads to an increase in the minimal number of females needed for survival at a value higher than the mathematically defined Allee effect. Using this effect, we focus our research on exploring the sensitivity of the optimized supply rate of supermale fish to the initial gender ratio and density of the wild populations. We find that the eradication strategy with optimized supply rate of supermales can be determined with knowledge of reproductive rate and survival fitness of supermale fish.

N2  - Alligators are crocodilians and among few species that endured the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. With long life spans, low metabolic rates, unusual immunological characteristics, including strong antibacterial and antiviral ability, and cancer resistance, crocodilians may hold information for molecular pathways underlying such physiological traits. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a group of calcium-activated enzymes that cause posttranslational protein deimination/citrullination in a range of target proteins contributing to protein moonlighting functions in health and disease. PADs are phylogenetically conserved and are also a key regulator of extracellular vesicle (EV) release, a critical part of cellular communication. As little is known about PAD-mediated mechanisms in reptile immunology, this study was aimed at profiling EVs and protein deimination in Alligator mississippiensis. Alligator plasma EVs were found to be polydispersed in a 50-400-nm size range. Key immune, metabolic, and gene regulatory proteins were identified to be posttranslationally deiminated in plasma and plasma EVs, with some overlapping hits, while some were unique to either plasma or plasma EVs. In whole plasma, 112 target proteins were identified to be deiminated, while 77 proteins were found as deiminated protein hits in plasma EVs, whereof 31 were specific for EVs only, including proteins specific for gene regulatory functions (e.g., histones). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed KEGG pathways specific to deiminated proteins in whole plasma related to adipocytokine signaling, while KEGG pathways of deiminated proteins specific to EVs included ribosome, biosynthesis of amino acids, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways as well as core histones. This highlights roles for EV-mediated export of deiminated protein cargo with roles in metabolism and gene regulation, also related to cancer. The identification of posttranslational deimination and EV-mediated communication in alligator plasma revealed here contributes to current understanding of protein moonlighting functions and EV-mediated communication in these ancient reptiles, providing novel insight into their unusual immune systems and physiological traits. In addition, our findings may shed light on pathways underlying cancer resistance, antibacterial and antiviral resistance, with translatable value to human pathologies.

N2  - Blue whales need to time their migration from their breeding grounds to their feeding grounds to avoid missing peak prey abundances, but the cues they use for this are unknown. We examine migration timing (inferred from the local onset and cessation of blue whale calls recorded on seafloor-mounted hydrophones), environmental conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll a), and prey (spring krill biomass from annual net tow surveys) during a 10 year period (2008-2017) in waters of the Southern California Region where blue whales feed in the summer. Colder sea surface temperature anomalies the previous season were correlated with greater krill biomass the following year, and earlier arrival by blue whales. Our results demonstrate a plastic response of blue whales to interannual variability and the importance of krill as a driving force behind migration timing. A decadal-scale increase in temperature due to climate change has led to blue whales extending their overall time in Southern California. By the end of our 10-year study, whales were arriving at the feeding grounds more than one month earlier, while their departure date did not change. Conservation strategies will need to account for increased anthropogenic threats resulting from longer times at the feeding grounds.

               <jats:p>Although the larval development of epigean palaemonid shrimps has been studied extensively, only a few investigations deal with stygobitic species. We present the larval development of the cave-adapted Creaseria morleyi (Creaser, 1936) from anchialine caves in the Tulum area, Quintana Roo, Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. Through the discovery of a series of larvae at different stages of development, we constructed a sequence extending through the juvenile stage. The larvae (41) were captured in plankton tows above the halocline at depths ranging between 11 and 15 m during eight surveys conducted between 2013 and 2016. Six larval stages and the first juvenile were identified; however, it is clear from the gradual modification of structures and appendages that more stages exist. The first larvae have a large quantity of vitellum and do not feed, since they have only rudimentary, and possibly non-functional, mouthparts. In the sixth stage and the juvenile, when the stages have no vitellum left, the mouthparts, chelae, and pleopods develop entirely. A comparison with other palaemonid shrimps suggests that C. morleyi has a greater affinity with those palaemonid species possessing extended larval development as is seen in species of MacrobrachiumSpence Bate, 1868.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>Tropical cyclones play an increasingly important role in shaping ecosystems. Understanding and generalizing their responses is challenging because of meteorological variability among storms and its interaction with ecosystems. We present a research framework designed to compare tropical cyclone effects within and across ecosystems that: a) uses a disaggregating approach that measures the responses of individual ecosystem components, b) links the response of ecosystem components at fine temporal scales to meteorology and antecedent conditions, and c) examines responses of ecosystem using a resistance–resilience perspective by quantifying the magnitude of change and recovery time. We demonstrate the utility of the framework using three examples of ecosystem response: gross primary productivity, stream biogeochemical export, and organismal abundances. Finally, we present the case for a network of sentinel sites with consistent monitoring to measure and compare ecosystem responses to cyclones across the United States, which could help improve coastal ecosystem resilience.</jats:p>

N2  - Economic development, coastal population growth, and expansion of tourism-related activities along coastlines have been the leading causes of marine debris pollution worldwide. While the problem of marine debris pollution has been increasingly recognized, there has been limited research on its socioeconomic drivers, primarily due to a paucity of consistent data on debris. The research described here utilizes newly available data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) on marine debris along eight coastal states of North America to examine the relationship of such debris pollution with socioeconomic variables including population, age, education, and tourism, as well as the mitigating effect of social capital on debris pollution. The results indicate that marine debris increases with income; however, at higher income levels the amount of pollution starts to decline, supporting the "Environmental Kuznets" hypothesis. We also find that population growth along coastlines contributes to greater debris accumulation. Our results further highlight the significant roles social capital and education play in curbing debris pollution. Understanding the socioeconomic drivers of marine debris is an important first step in informing abatement policy and allocation of resources by public agencies to address the marine pollution problem.

N2  - Hurricane Harvey was the wettest hurricane in US history bringing record rainfall and widespread flooding in Houston, TX. The resulting storm- and floodwaters largely emptied into the Galveston Bay. Surface water was collected from 10 stations during five cruises to investigate the concentrations and sources of 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and relative abundances of PAH-degrading bacteria. Highest PAH levels (102-167 ng/L) were detected during the first sampling event, decreasing to 36-69 ng/L within a week. Four sites had elevated concentrations of carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene that exceeded the Texas Standard for Surface Water threshold. The highest relative abundances of known PAH-degrading bacteria Burkholderiaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Sphingomonadales were detected during the first and second sampling events. PAH origins were about 60% pyrogenic, 2% petrogenic, and the remainder of mixed sources. This study improves our understanding on the fate, source, and distributions of PAHs in Galveston Bay after an extreme flooding event.

N2  - Diatoms play a key role in the marine carbon cycle with their high primary productivity and release of exudates such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP). These exudates contribute to aggregates (marine snow) that rapidly transport organic material to the seafloor, potentially capturing contaminants like petroleum components. Ocean acidification (OA) impacts marine organisms, especially those that utilize inorganic carbon for photosynthesis and EPS production. Here we investigated the response of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown to present day and future ocean conditions in the presence of a water accommodated fraction (WAF and OAWAF) of oil and a diluted chemically enhanced WAF (DCEWAF and OADCEWAF). T. pseudonana responded to WAF/DCEWAF but not OA and no multiplicative effect of the two factors (i.e., OA and oil/dispersant) was observed. T. pseudonana released more colloidal EPS (< 0.7 μm to > 3 kDa) in the presence of WAF/DCEWAF/OAWAF/OADCEWAF than in the corresponding Controls. Colloidal EPS and particulate EPS in the oil/dispersant treatments have higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratios than those in the control treatments, and thus are likely stickier and have a greater potential to form aggregates of marine oil snow. More TEP was produced in response to WAF than in Controls; OA did not influence its production. Polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations and distributions were significantly impacted by the presence of dispersants but not OA. PAHs especially Phenanthrenes, Anthracenes, Chrysenes, Fluorenes, Fluoranthenes, Pyrenes, Dibenzothiophenes and 1-Methylphenanthrene show major variations in the aggregate and surrounding seawater fraction of oil and oil plus dispersant treatments. Studies like this add to the current knowledge of the combined effects of aggregation, marine snow formation, and the potential impacts of oil spills under ocean acidification scenarios.

N2  - The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is globally distributed with established coastal and open-ocean movement patterns in many portions of its range. While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the species' movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of the core habitats identified here.

N2  - <jats:p>Photovoltaic (PV) is a highly promising energy source because of its environment friendly property. However, there is an uncertainty present in the modeling of PV modules owing to varying irradiance and temperature. To solve such uncertainty, the fuzzy logic control-based intelligent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method is observed to be more suitable as compared with conventional algorithms in PV systems. In this paper, an isolated PV system using a push pull converter with the fuzzy logic-based MPPT algorithm is presented. The proposed methodology optimizes the output power of PV modules and achieves isolation with high DC gain. The DC gain is inverted into a single phase AC through a closed loop fuzzy logic inverter with a low pass filter to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD). Dynamic simulations are developed in Matlab/Simulink by MathWorks under linear loads. The results show that the fuzzy logic algorithms of the proposed system efficiently track the MPPT and present reduced THD.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Parameters associated with electrical equivalent models of the photovoltaic (PV) system play a significant role in the performance enhancement of the PV system. However, the accurate estimation of these parameters signifies a challenging task due to the higher computational complexities and non-linear characteristics of the PV modules/panels. Hence, an effective, dynamic, and efficient optimization technique is required to estimate the parameters associated with PV models. This paper proposes a double exponential function-based dynamic inertia weight (DEDIW) strategy for the optimal parameter estimation of the PV cell and module that maintains an appropriate balance between the exploitation and exploration phases to mitigate the premature convergence problem of conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO). The proposed approach (DEDIWPSO) is validated for three test systems; (1) RTC France solar cell, (2) Photo-watt (PWP 201) PV module, and (3) a practical test system (JKM330P-72, 310 W polycrystalline PV module) which involve data collected under real environmental conditions for both single- and double-diode models. Results illustrate that the parameters obtained from proposed technique are better than those from the conventional PSO and various other techniques presented in the literature. Additionally, a comparison of the statistical results reveals that the proposed methodology is highly accurate, reliable, and efficient.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>A strong energy mix of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is needed for sustainable development in the electricity sector. India stands as one of the fastest developing countries in terms of RES production. In this framework, the main objective of this review is to critically scrutinize the Maharashtra state energy landscape to discover the gaps, barriers, and challenges therein and to provide recommendations and suggestions for attaining the RES target by 2022. This work begins with a discussion about the RES trends in various developing countries. Subsequently, it scrutinizes the installed capacity of India, reporting that Maharashtra state holds a considerable stake in the Indian energy mix. A further examination of the state energy mix is carried out by comparing the current and future targets of the state action plan. It is found that the installed capacity of RESs accounts for about 22% of the state energy mix. Moreover, the current installed capacity trend is markedly different from the goals set out in the action plan of the state. Notably, the installed capacity of solar energy is four times less than the target for 2020. Importantly, meeting the targeted RES capacity for 2022 presents a great challenge to the state. Considering this, an analysis of the state’s strengths, barriers, and challenges is presented. Moreover, strong suggestions and recommendations are provided to clear the track to reach the desired destination. This can be useful for the government agencies, research community, private investors, policymakers, and stakeholders involved in building a sustainable energy system for the future.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Tracking performance and stability play a major role in observer design for speed estimation purpose in motor drives used in vehicles. It is all the more prevalent at lower speed ranges. There was a need to have a tradeoff between these parameters ensuring the speed bandwidth remains as wide as possible. This work demonstrates an improved static and dynamic performance of a sliding mode state observer used for speed sensorless 3 phase induction motor drive employed in electric vehicles (EVs). The estimated torque is treated as a model disturbance and integrated into the state observer while the error is constrained in the sliding hyperplane. Two state observers with different disturbance handling mechanisms have been designed. Depending on, how they reject disturbances, based on their structure, their performance is studied and analyzed with respect to speed bandwidth, tracking and disturbance handling capability. The proposed observer with superior disturbance handling capabilities is able to provide a wider speed range, which is a main issue in EV. Here, a new dimension of model based design strategy is employed namely the Processor-in-Loop. The concept is validated in a real-time model based design test bench powered by RT-lab. The plant and the controller are built in a Simulink environment and made compatible with real-time blocksets and the system is executed in real-time targets OP4500/OP5600 (Opal-RT). Additionally, the Processor-in-Loop hardware verification is performed by using two adapters, which are used to loop-back analog and digital input and outputs. It is done to include a real-world signal routing between the plant and the controller thereby, ensuring a real-time interaction between the plant and the controller. Results validated portray better disturbance handling, steady state and a dynamic tracking profile, higher speed bandwidth and lesser torque pulsations compared to the conventional observer.</jats:p>

N2  - Marine oil spills can impact both coastal and offshore marine environments, but little information is available on how the microbial response to oil and dispersants might differ between these biomes. Here, we describe the compositional and functional response of microbial communities to different concentrations of oil and chemically dispersed oil in coastal and offshore surface waters from the Texas-Louisiana continental shelf. Using a combination of analytical chemistry and 16S rRNA amplicon and metatranscriptomic sequencing, we provide a broad, comparative overview of the ecological response of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and their expression of hydrocarbon-degrading genes in marine surface waters over time between two oceanic biomes. We found evidence for the existence of different ecotypes of several commonly described hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial taxa which behaved differentially in coastal and offshore shelf waters despite being exposed to similar concentrations of oil, dispersants, and nutrients. This resulted in the differential expression of catabolic pathways for n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-the two major categories of compounds found in crude oil-with preferential expression of n-alkane degradation genes in coastal waters while offshore microbial communities trended more toward the expression of PAH degradation genes. This was unexpected as it contrasts with the generally held view that n-alkanes, being more labile, are attacked before the more refractory PAHs. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the existence and potential consequences of niche partitioning of hydrocarbon-degrading taxa between neighboring marine environments.IMPORTANCE In the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the taxonomic response of marine microbial communities to oil and dispersants has been extensively studied. However, relatively few studies on the functional response of these microbial communities have been reported, especially in a longitudinal fashion. Moreover, despite the fact that marine oil spills typically impact thousands of square kilometers of both coastal and offshore marine environments, little information is available on how the microbial response to oil and dispersants might differ between these biomes. The results of this study help fill this critical knowledge gap and provide valuable insight into how oil spill response efforts, such as chemically dispersing oil, may have differing effects in neighboring coastal and offshore marine environments.

N2  - <jats:p>The role of socio-demographic vulnerability to hazards is an increasingly important aspect for consideration in disaster mitigation and adaptation. This paper examines the spatial adjustments of populations to the 2008 Hurricane Ike by estimating the effects of damage on the changes of socially vulnerable populations pre- and post-Hurricane Ike. Multivariate regression models are used to understand household-level adjustments in different flood zones and inundation levels at the block-group level in Galveston county. In contrast to past literature that suggests that vulnerable populations remain or move into hazardous areas post-disaster, our results indicate that socially vulnerable populations have moved out of highly damaged areas. The tremendous investment opportunity post-disaster and the slow distribution of funds to recover public housing on Galveston Island provide potential explanation of the estimated adjustment patterns. Analyzing post disaster adjustments offers important insights into the “resilient” recovery of Galveston County post-Hurricane Ike. Our results also point to potential vulnerabilities that may arise in the future because of the change in community identity and the loss of social memory. Understanding disaster-driven changes in community make-up will help inform potential recovery trajectories from future catastrophes.</jats:p>

N2  - Exposure to extreme events is a major concern in coastal regions where growing human populations and stressed natural ecosystems are at significant risk to such phenomena. However, the complex sequence of processes that transform an event from notable to extreme can be challenging to identify and hence, limit forecast abilities. Here, we show an extreme heat content event (i.e., a marine heatwave) in coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico resulted from compounding effects of a tropical storm followed by an atmospheric heatwave. This newly identified process of generating extreme ocean temperatures occurred prior to landfall of Hurricane Michael during October of 2018 and, as critical contributor to storm intensity, likely contributed to the subsequent extreme hurricane. This pattern of compounding processes will also exacerbate other environmental problems in temperature-sensitive ecosystems (e.g., coral bleaching, hypoxia) and is expected to have expanding impacts under global warming predictions.

N2  - Oxygen is necessary for all marine animals to support metabolic functions. When chronic low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions occur, organisms must adjust to overcome this stressor's effect on metabolic rates. The bearded fireworm, Hermodice carunculata, is a widespread species frequently exposed to hypoxic conditions in areas within its broad distribution which may impact metabolism, wound healing, and regeneration. To study the impact of hypoxia on their metabolic rates, we exposed fireworms to two levels of lower than normal DO conditions (low 2.5 ± 0.25 mg O2 L-1 and mid 4.5 ± 0.25 mg O2 L-1) for 7 days by pumping nitrogen into their holding tanks. During a chronic hypoxia trial, we quantified oxygen consumption in each experimental group and subsequently determined post-hypoxia oxygen consumption of individuals from the lowest oxygen level. During the hypoxic exposure, the oxygen uptake rates declined in low and mid DO conditions, while remaining relatively constant for the normoxic (7.0 ± 0.25 mg O2 L-1) control. We then compared the oxygen consumption rates from the lowest DO condition to fireworms likely never exposed to hypoxia and fireworms from a location likely to be exposed to hypoxia. We found higher oxygen consumption rates in the experimentally hypoxia-exposed worms. These results suggest prolonged negative impacts of hypoxic exposure, leading to a lasting elevation of metabolic rates of these marine invertebrates. The increase in metabolic rates may lead to increased predation on their prey of choice, economically and commercially important coral, causing increased degradation of already threatened coral reef ecosystems.

N2  - The predominant model of the role of viruses in the marine trophic web is that of the "viral shunt," where viral infection funnels a substantial fraction of the microbial primary and secondary production back to the pool of dissolved organic matter. Here, we analyzed the composition of non-eukaryotic DNA associated with individual cells of small, planktonic protists in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) and the Mediterranean Sea. We found viral DNA associated with a substantial fraction cells from the GoM (51%) and the Mediterranean Sea (35%). While Mediterranean SAGs contained a larger proportion of cells containing bacterial sequences (49%), a smaller fraction of cells contained bacterial sequences in the GoM (19%). In GoM cells, nearly identical bacteriophage and ssDNA virus sequences where found across diverse lineages of protists, suggesting many of these viruses are non-infective. The fraction of cells containing viral DNA varied among protistan lineages and reached 100% in Picozoa and Choanozoa. These two groups also contained significantly higher numbers of viral sequences than other identified taxa. We consider mechanisms that may explain the presence of viral DNA in protistan cells and conclude that protistan predation on free viral particles contributed to the observed patterns. These findings confirm prior experiments with protistan isolates and indicate that the viral shunt is complemented by a viral link in the marine microbial food web. This link may constitute a sink of viral particles in the ocean and has implications for the flow of carbon through the microbial food web.

N2  - <jats:p>Quantitative surveys of fishes associated with artificial reefs in the northwest Gulf of Mexico were conducted over a 4-yr period (2014–2017). Artificial reefs surveyed were comprised of three types: concrete structures, rig jackets, and decommissioned ships. All reefs were surveyed
 using vertical long line (VLL), fish traps, and Adaptive Resolution Imaging Sonar (ARIS 1800). Mean fish abundance did not significantly differ using VLL [1.7 ind set –1 (SD 2.2)] among the three reef types. However, relative abundance among all fishes collected was significantly highest
 on rig reefs using traps [6.2 ind soak<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> (SD 3.8)], while results from sonar surveys indicated that the mean relative fish density was highest on concrete reefs [15.3 fish frame<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> (SD 26.8)]. Red snapper (<jats:italic>n =</jats:italic> 792), followed by gray triggerfish (<jats:italic>n
 =</jats:italic> 130), pigfish (<jats:italic>n =</jats:italic> 70), tomtate (<jats:italic>n =</jats:italic> 69), and hardhead catfish (<jats:italic>n =</jats:italic> 57) were the most numerically abundant species using VLL and traps; red snapper comprised 90.7% of total catch using VLL and 43.9% using traps. Mean Brillouin's diversity (<jats:italic>H<jats:sub>B</jats:sub></jats:italic>) was
 highest on ships using VLL [0.41 (SD 0.14)] and highest on rigs using traps [0.87 (SD 0.58)] compared to the lowest diversity found on concrete [VLL 0.07 (SD 0.11); traps 0.36 (SD 0.32)]. Findings from this study can be used to inform the planning of future artificial reefs and their effect
 on the assemblages of reef-associated fishes. Additionally, these results highlight the value of using multiple gear types to survey reef fish assemblages associated with artificial reefs.</jats:p>

N2  - Northern elephant seals (NES, Mirounga angustirostris) undergo an annual molt during which they spend ∼40 days fasting on land with reduced activity and lose approximately one-quarter of their body mass. Reduced activity and muscle load in stereotypic terrestrial mammalian models results in decreased muscle mass and capacity for force production and aerobic metabolism. However, the majority of lost mass in fasting female NES is from fat while muscle mass is largely preserved. Although muscle mass is preserved, potential changes to the metabolic and contractile capacity are unknown. To assess potential changes in NES skeletal muscle during molt, we collected muscle biopsies from 6 adult female NES before the molt and after ∼30 days at the end of the molt. Skeletal muscle was assessed for respiratory capacity using high resolution respirometry, and RNA was extracted to assess changes in gene expression. Despite a month of reduced activity, fasting, and weight loss, skeletal muscle respiratory capacity was preserved with no change in OXPHOS respiratory capacity. Molt was associated with 162 upregulated genes including those favoring lipid metabolism. We identified 172 downregulated genes including those coding for ribosomal proteins and genes associated with skeletal muscle force transduction and glucose metabolism. Following ∼30 days of molt, NES skeletal muscle metabolic capacity is preserved although mechanotransduction may be compromised. In the absence of exercise stimulus, fasting-induced shifts in muscle metabolism may stimulate pathways associated with preserving the mass and metabolic capacity of slow oxidative muscle.

N2  - The northern Bahamas have experienced more frequent intense-hurricane impacts than almost anywhere else in the Atlantic since 1850 CE. In 2019, category 5 (Saffir-Simpson scale) Hurricane Dorian demonstrated the destructive potential of these natural hazards. Problematically, determining whether high hurricane activity levels remained constant through time is difficult given the short observational record (< 170 years). We present a 700-year long, near-annually resolved stratigraphic record of hurricane passage near Thatchpoint Blue Hole (TPBH) on Abaco Island, The Bahamas. Using longer sediment cores (888 cm) and more reliable age-control, this study revises and temporally expands a previous study from TPBH that underestimated the sedimentation rate. TPBH records at least 13 ≥ category 2 hurricanes per century between 1500 to 1670 CE, which exceeds the 9 ≥ category 2 hurricanes per century within 50 km of TPBH since 1850 CE. The eastern United States also experienced frequent hurricanes from 1500 to 1670 CE, but frequency was depressed elsewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. This suggests that spatial heterogeneity in Atlantic hurricane activity since 1850 CE could have persisted throughout the last millennium. This heterogeneity is impacted by climatic and stochastic forcing, but additional high-resolution paleo-hurricane reconstructions are required to assess the mechanisms that impact regional variability.

N2  - The recent identification of the bio-duck call as Antarctic minke whale (AMW) vocalization allows the use of passive acoustic monitoring to retrospectively investigate year-round spatial-temporal patterns in minke whale occurrence in ice-covered areas. Here, we present an analysis of AMW occurrence patterns based on a 9-year passive acoustic dataset (2008-2016) from 21 locations throughout the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea). AMWs were detected acoustically at all mooring locations from May to December, with the highest presence between August and November (bio-duck calls present at more than 80% of days). At the southernmost recording locations, the bio-duck call was present up to 10 months of the year. Substantial inter-annual variation in the seasonality of vocal activity correlated to variation in local ice concentration. Our analysis indicates that part of the AMW population stays in the Weddell Sea during austral winter. The period with the highest acoustic presence in the Weddell Sea (September-October) coincides with the timing of the breeding season of AMW in lower latitudes. The bio-duck call could therefore play a role in mating, although other behavioural functions of the call cannot be excluded to date.

In this study, we investigated the concentrations and distributions of the 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine snow aggregates collected during a mesocosm experiment. Seawater only, oil in a water accommodated fraction (WAF), and Corexit-enhanced WAF (DCEWAF) were incubated for 16 d. Both WAF and DCEWAF aggregates were enriched in heavy molecular weight PAHs but depleted in naphthalene. DCEWAF aggregates had 2.6 times more total 16 PAHs than the WAF (20.5 vs. 7.8 µg/g). Aggregates in the WAF and DCEWAF incorporated 4.4% and 19.3%, respectively of the total PAHs in the mesocosm tanks. Our results revealed that marine snow sorbed and scavenged heavy molecular weight PAHs in the water column and the application of Corexit enhanced the incorporation of PAHs into the sinking aggregates.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Hazard information plays an important role in how risk perceptions are formed and what actions are taken in response to risk. While past studies have shown that information on water and air pollution is associated with changes to individual behavior, there is a need for examination of water quality information in the context of environmental disturbances. This study fills that gap by examining water pollution in an active industrial region of the United States—the Galveston Bay of Texas. Using original survey data collected in 2019 of 525 adults living in the Galveston Bay region, logistic regression was used to analyze the association of awareness and use of water pollution information on changes to outdoor activities and consumption of drinking water and/or seafood. Controls for chronic and acute exposure to environmental hazards, environmental knowledge and experience, and demographics were included in the model. The findings indicate frequent use of water quality information is significantly associated with action to reduce risk. On average, an individual who checks water pollution monitoring every day is 26% and 33% more likely to change their outdoor activities and consumption behavior, respectively, than someone who is not aware of this information. There is a need for improvement in pollution data collection and the development of a risk communication framework that facilitates the dissemination of this information in relevant, accessible, and credible ways.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Capitellid polychaetes are ubiquitous throughout the world’s oceans and are often encountered in high abundance. We used an extensive dataset of species abundance and distribution records of the <jats:italic>Capitella capitata</jats:italic> complex, <jats:italic>C. aciculata</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>C. jonesi</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Heteromastus filiformis</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Mediomastus ambiseta</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>M. californiensis</jats:italic> from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, as a model system of closely related species filling a similar ecological niche. We sought to (1) characterize the spatial distribution of each species, (2) determine if a single species abundance modeling strategy could be applied to them all, and (3) assess environmental drivers of species distribution and abundance. We found that all species had a zero-inflated abundance distribution and there was spatial autocorrelation by bay regions. Lorenz curves were an effective tool to assess spatial patterns of species abundance across large areas. Bay segment, depth, and dissolved oxygen were the most important environmental drivers. Modeling was accomplished by comparing 6 different approaches: 4 generalized additive models (GAMs: Poisson, negative binomial, Tweedie, and zero-inflated Poisson distributions), hurdle models, and boosted regression trees. There was no single model with top performance for every species. However, GAM-Tweedie and hurdle models performed well overall and may be useful for studies of other benthic marine invertebrates.</jats:p>

N2  - Hurricane Michael (2018) was the first Category 5 storm on record to make landfall on the Florida panhandle since at least 1851 CE (Common Era), and it resulted in the loss of 59 lives and $25 billion in damages across the southeastern U.S. This event placed a spotlight on recent intense (exceeding Category 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) hurricane landfalls, prompting questions about the natural range in variability of hurricane activity that the instrumental record is too short to address. Of particular interest is determining whether the frequency of recent intense hurricane landfalls in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is within or outside the natural range of intense hurricane activity prior to 1851 CE. In this study, we identify intense hurricane landfalls in northwest Florida during the past 2000 years based on coarse anomaly event detection from two coastal lacustrine sediment archives. We identified a historically unprecedented period of heightened storm activity common to four Florida panhandle localities from 650 to 1250 CE and a shift to a relatively quiescent storm climate in the GOM spanning the past six centuries. Our study provides long-term context for events like Hurricane Michael and suggests that the observational period 1851 CE to present may underrepresent the natural range in landfalling hurricane activity.

N2  - <jats:p>Blue whales <jats:italic>Balaenoptera musculus</jats:italic> at South Georgia were heavily exploited during 20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> century industrial whaling, to the point of local near-extirpation. Although legal whaling for blue whales ceased in the 1960s, and there were indications of blue whale recovery across the wider Southern Ocean area, blue whales were seldom seen in South Georgia waters in subsequent years. We collated 30 yr of data comprising opportunistic sightings, systematic visual and acoustic surveys and photo-identification to assess the current distribution of blue whales in the waters surrounding South Georgia. Over 34000 km of systematic survey data between 1998 and 2018 resulted in only a single blue whale sighting, although opportunistic sightings were reported over that time period. However, since 2018 there have been increases in both sightings of blue whales and detections of their vocalisations. A survey in 2020 comprising visual line transect surveys and directional frequency analysis and recording (DIFAR) sonobuoy deployments resulted in 58 blue whale sightings from 2430 km of visual effort, including the photo-identification of 23 individual blue whales. Blue whale vocalisations were detected on all 31 sonobuoys deployed (114 h). In total, 41 blue whales were photo-identified from South Georgia between 2011 and 2020, none of which matched the 517 whales in the current Antarctic catalogue. These recent data suggest that blue whales have started to return to South Georgia waters, but continued visual and acoustic surveys are required to monitor any future changes in their distribution and abundance.</jats:p>

N2  - Sequential diving by wild marine mammals results in a lifetime of rapid physiological transitions between lung collapse-reinflation, bradycardia-tachycardia, vasoconstriction-vasodilation, and oxygen store depletion-restoration. The result is a cycle of normoxia and hypoxia in which blood oxygen partial pressures can decline to <20-30 mmHg during a dive, a level considered injurious to oxygen-dependent human tissues (i.e., brain, heart). Safeguards in the form of enhanced on-board oxygen stores, selective oxygen transport, and unique tissue buffering capacities enable marine-adapted mammals to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy metabolism even when breathing and pulmonary gas exchange cease. This stands in stark contrast to the vulnerability of oxygen-sensitive tissues in humans that may undergo irreversible damage within minutes of ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Recently, these differences in protection against hypoxic injury have become evident in the systemic, multi-organ physiological failure during COVID-19 infection in humans. Prolonged recoveries in some patients have led to delays in the return to normal exercise levels and cognitive function even months later. Rather than a single solution to this problem, we find that marine mammals rely on a unique, integrative assemblage of protections to avoid the deleterious impacts of hypoxia on tissues. Built across evolutionary time, these solutions provide a natural template for identifying the potential for tissue damage when oxygen is lacking, and for guiding management decisions to support oxygen-deprived tissues in other mammalian species, including humans, challenged by hypoxia.

N2  - High usage of the synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) has led to significant presence of this pharmaceutical group in surface waters where it can affect non-target organisms such as fish. Assessment of a fish's metabolism and swimming performance provide reliable sub-lethal measures of effects of GCs on oxygen-requiring processes and ability to swim. In this study, we determined time-dependent (7, 14 and 21 days) effects of the synthetic GC prednisone (1 μg L-1) on sheepshead minnow (SHM) (Cyprinodon variegatus). Standard (SMR), routine (RMR) and maximum (MMR) metabolic rate, metabolic scope (MS), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), cost of transport (COT) and critical swimming speed (Ucrit) were determined. Twenty-one days exposure to prednisone resulted in significantly higher SMR, RMR, MMR, MS, EPOC and COT compared with 7d and 14d prednisone fish. However, Ucrit was not significantly different between prednisone and solvent control exposed fish (within 7d, 14d, 21d groups). SMR, RMR and MMR were lower in the 7d and 14d prednisone exposed fish compared with their solvent control groups. In contrast, SMR, RMR and MMR were all significantly higher in the 21d prednisone exposed fish compared with solvent control. EPOC was significantly higher in 14d prednisone exposed fish and trending higher in 21d and 7d prednisone exposed fish compared with their solvent controls. EPOC was significantly higher in 21d compared with 7d prednisone exposed fish. A significantly higher COT was seen in the 21d compared with 7d and 14d prednisone fish. Collectively, this study showed time-dependent effects of prednisone on SHM metabolism and swimming performance.

N2  - <jats:p>  	Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>has emerged as a promising material for next generation power electronics. While β-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (monoclinic) is the most stable and studied of six Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> polymorphs, the slightly less energetically favorable α-, ε-, and κ-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> phases have unique characteristics that can be exploited such as larger bandgaps, alloying for dopant control, or polarization beneficial to the formation of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channels. Specifically, α-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>(rhombohedral, corundum) has the largest bandgap of ~5.3 eV and can be alloyed with α-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (8.8 eV) and α-In<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (3.7 eV) for bandgap engineering. Both ε-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (hexagonal, <jats:italic>P6<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>mc</jats:italic>) and κ-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>(orthorhombic, <jats:italic>Pna2<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>
                  </jats:italic>) phases are polar, with a predicted spontaneous polarization strength up to 10 times larger than GaN and 3 times larger than AlN. Like the III-N system, polarization induced charges can lead to higher charge densities and mobilities in 2DEGs formed at heterojunctions, which would improve the viability of Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> electronic devices. Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is a popular, conformal, energy-enhanced synthesis method for thin films due to its many advantages, including: deposition at reduced growth temperatures, access to metastable phases, improved crystallinity, and increased growth rates. In this work, we use PEALD to produce high-quality heteroepitaxial Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and (Al<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Ga<jats:sub>1-x</jats:sub>)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (AlGO) films and investigate materials properties such as phase selectivity, ternary solubility limits, and electrical and optical performance.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>All Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films were deposited in a Veeco Fiji G2 reactor equipped with a load lock and turbo pump using trimethygallium, trimethylaluminum, and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> plasma. Initial studies on c-plane sapphire substrates at 350°C and 8 mTorr show the phase could be altered from β to α by a varying the pure O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> flow during plasma pulse from 5-40 sccm [1]. Optical emission spectroscopy indicate that the changes in the relative concentration of atomic oxygen is crucial for phase selectivity while the high ion flux to the surface can contribute to the crystallinity at low T<jats:sub>g </jats:sub>[2]. To grow ε(κ)-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> on c-plane sapphire required going to a much higher temperature (500°C), pressure (100’s mTorr), and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> flow (100sccm) [1]. Without modifications to the current ALD system, pure ε(κ)-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> on sapphire was not achieved under any conditions. Using optimum growth conditions for the three phases on sapphire, films were deposited on GaN and diamond to determine the effect of substrate structure. Transmission electron microscopy was conducted to determine the specific phases (β, ε, and κ) present in each case, and showed the amount of each phase varied with PEALD parameters. While films on diamond resulted in mixed β/ε(κ) phases, pure ε(κ)-phase films were attained on GaN and the strain varied with pressure and T<jats:sub>g</jats:sub>. Vertical breakdown measurements were taken for both β- and ε(κ)-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/n+ GaN substrates. Breakdown fields varied between 3.8-7.0 MV/cm dependent on the phase and strained state of the Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films. β-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films showed less variability in breakdown field from device to device than ε(κ)-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films, but neither showed a dependence on device size.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>While PEALD is beneficial for depositing thin films of metastable phases, practical devices often require much thicker barrier and active layers. For this reason, we investigated integrating PEALD metastable Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films with traditional semiconductor deposition techniques, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), capable of extending these layers beyond 100 nm in thickness. The same MBE conditions were used to deposit Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films on GaN substrates with and without PEALD ε(κ)-Ga<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> nucleation layers. Those deposited without the PEALD metastable nucleation layer resulted in stable β-phase films, while those with nucleation layers resulted in pure ε(κ)-phase films.

               <jats:p>Finally, to investigate heterojunctions for 2DEG formation, Al<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Ga<jats:sub>1-x</jats:sub>O films were developed. While the full stoichiometric range could be reached using a PEALD digital alloying method, crystallinity was lost above x = 0.2 for the β phase, x = 0.35 for the ε(κ) phase, and x=0.6 for the α phase. Initial device structures will be shown in order to establish the feasibility of these films in device applications.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Financial technical analysis of markets and trends differs from fundamental analysis in that econometrics are used on “fundamental” economic data in fundamental analysis. Technical analysis, however, adds to the overall trend analysis an additional examination of the psychology of markets. For freight rate predictions, there has been an exclusive reliance on typical fundamental analysis. Our results indicate that adding technical analysis to freight rate prediction can provide a better overall result. Psychological forces such as “irrational exuberance” or severe bearishness can influence trend predictions making them at best incomplete and at worst inaccurate for predicting the demand for shipping services. Further, ship construction decisions use freight rate predictions. In this paper, we perform a 20-year technical analysis of the BDI/Baltic Dry Index (formerly BFI/Baltic Freight Index) This analysis is a better, richer evaluation of freight rate trends that influence ship construction. Furthermore, technical analysis requires specific in-depth knowledge of the psychology of the market and experience in this type of trend analysis.</jats:p>

N2  - The substantial increase in plastic pollution in marine ecosystems raises concerns about its adverse impacts on the microbial community. Microorganisms (bacteria, phytoplankton) are important producers of exopolymeric substances (EPS), which govern the processes of marine organic aggregate formation, microbial colonization, and pollutant mobility. Until now, the effects of nano- and micro-plastics on characteristics of EPS composition have received little attention. This study investigated EPS secretion by four phytoplankton species following exposure to various concentrations of polystyrene nano- and microplastics (55 nm nanoparticles; 1 and 6 μm microparticles). The 55 nm nanoparticles induced less growth/survival (determined on a DNA basis) and produced EPS with higher protein-to-carbohydrate (P/C) ratios than the exposure to microplastic particles. The amount of DNA from the four marine phytoplankton showed a higher negative linear correlation with increasing P/C ratios, especially in response to nanoplastic exposure. These results provide evidence that marine phytoplankton are quite sensitive to smaller-sized plastics and actively modify their EPS chemical composition to cope with the stress from pollution. Furthermore, the release of protein-rich EPS was found to facilitate aggregate formation and surface modification of plastic particles, thereby affecting their fate and colonization. Overall, this work offers new insights into the potential harm of different-sized plastic particles and a better understanding of the responding mechanism of marine phytoplankton for plastic pollution. The data also provide needed information about the fate of marine plastics and biogenic aggregation and scavenging processes.

N2  - The cycling and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is not well understood in estuarine systems. It is critical now more than ever given the increased ecosystem pressures on these critical coastal habitats. A budget of PAHs and cycling has been created for Galveston Bay (Texas) in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, an estuary surrounded by 30-50% of the US capacity of oil refineries and chemical industry. We estimate that approximately 3 to 4 mt per year of pyrogenic PAHs are introduced to Galveston Bay via gaseous exchange from the atmosphere (ca. 2 mt/year) in addition to numerous spills of petrogenic PAHs from oil and gas operations (ca. 1.0 to 1.9 mt/year). PAHs are cycled through and stored in the biota, and ca. 20 to 30% of the total (0.8 to 1.5 mt per year) are estimated to be buried in the sediments. Oysters concentrate PAHs to levels above their surroundings (water and sediments) and contain substantially greater concentrations than other fish catch (shrimp, blue crabs and fin fish). Smaller organisms (infaunal invertebrates, phytoplankton and zooplankton) might also retain a significant fraction of the total, but direct evidence for this is lacking. The amount of PAHs delivered to humans in seafood, based on reported landings, is trivially small compared to the total inputs, sediment accumulation and other possible fates (metabolic remineralization, export in tides, etc.), which remain poorly known. The generally higher concentrations in biota from Galveston Bay compared to other coastal habitats can be attributed to both intermittent spills of gas and oil and the bay's close proximity to high production of pyrogenic PAHs within the urban industrial complex of the city of Houston as well as periodic flood events that transport PAHs from land surfaces to the Bay.

N2  - <jats:p>The pelagic Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is a complex system of dynamic physical oceanography (western boundary current, mesoscale eddies), high biological diversity, and community integration via diel vertical migration and lateral advection. Humans also heavily utilize this system, including its deep-sea components, for resource extraction, shipping, tourism, and other commercial activity. This utilization has had impacts, some with disastrous consequences. The <jats:italic>Deepwater Horizon</jats:italic> oil spill (DWHOS) occurred at a depth of ∼1500 m (Macondo wellhead), creating a persistent and toxic mixture of hydrocarbons and dispersant in the deep-pelagic (water column below 200 m depth) habitat. In order to assess the impacts of the DWHOS on this habitat, two large-scale research programs, described herein, were designed and executed. These programs, ONSAP and DEEPEND, aimed to quantitatively characterize the oceanic ecosystem of the northern GoM and to establish a time-series with which natural and anthropogenic changes could be detected. The approach was multi-disciplinary in nature and included <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> sampling, acoustic sensing, water column profiling and sampling, satellite remote sensing, AUV sensing, numerical modeling, genetic sequencing, and biogeochemical analyses. The synergy of these methodologies has provided new and unprecedented perspectives of an oceanic ecosystem with respect to composition, connectivity, drivers, and variability.</jats:p>

N2  - Keratinized tissues, including whiskers, are ideal for acquiring a record of physiological parameters. Most tissues provide a snapshot of physiological status; however, whiskers may support longitudinal sampling for reproductive and stress-related hormones, if hormones are incorporated as whiskers grow and concentrations change with physiological state. Whiskers from female Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) and northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) were serially sectioned and pulverized and steroid hormones were extracted. Standard methods were used to validate enzyme immunoassay kits for cortisol, progesterone, 17β-estradiol and testosterone. All hormones were measurable in whisker segments from both species with progesterone concentrations showing cyclical patterns, which appear to signify previous pregnancies or luteal phases. Yearly progesterone concentrations were greater in years a pup was produced compared with years when no pup was observed. Free-ranging female Steller sea lions had reproductive rates between 0 and 1.0 (0.53 ± 0.33, n = 12) using a yearly progesterone concentration of 30 pg/mg or greater to classify a reproductive year as producing a pup and below 30 pg/mg as non-reproductive. Cortisol concentrations were greater near the root and rapidly declined, lacking any obvious patterns, throughout the rest of the whisker. Progesterone and testosterone concentrations were able to help determine sex of unknown individuals. Immunohistochemistry revealed that steroid hormones most likely do not leach out of whiskers based on the deposition patterns of progesterone and cortisol being present throughout the whisker length. Overall, measuring steroid hormones in whiskers can reveal individual reproductive histories over multiple years in sea lions and fur seals. Cyclical patterns of δ15N were useful for identifying periods of up to ~10 years of growth within whiskers, and measuring both stable isotopes and hormones may be useful for differentiating periods of active gestation from diapause and potentially track multi-year reproductive histories of female otariids.

N2  - <jats:p>Effective management of wild animal populations relies on an understanding of their spatio-temporal distributions. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a non-invasive method to investigate the distribution of free-ranging species that reliably produce sound. Critically endangered Antarctic blue whales (<jats:italic>Balaenoptera musculus intermedia</jats:italic>) (ABWs) co-occur with pygmy blue whales (<jats:italic>B. m. brevicauda</jats:italic>) (PBWs) around New Zealand. Nationally, both are listed as “data deficient” due to difficulties in access and visual sub-species identification. PAM was used to investigate the distributions of blue whales<jats:italic>via</jats:italic>sub-species specific song detections in central New Zealand. Propagation models, incorporating ambient noise data, enabled the comparison of detections among recording locations in different marine environments. ABW detections peaked during austral winter and spring, indicating that New Zealand, and the South Taranaki Bight (STB) in particular, is a migratory corridor for ABWs. Some ABW calls were also detected during the breeding season (September and October). PBW calls were highly concentrated in the STB, particularly between March and May, suggesting that an aggregation of PBWs may occur here. Therefore, the STB is of great importance for both sub-species of blue whale. PBW detections were absent from the STB during parts of austral spring, but PBWs were detected at east coast locations during this time. Detection area models were valuable when interpreting and comparing detections among recording locations. The results provide sub-species specific information required for management of critically endangered ABWs and highlight the relative importance of central New Zealand for both sub-species of blue whale.</jats:p>

N2  - The ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prevails as an ultimatum to the global economic growth and henceforth, all of society since neither a curing drug nor a preventing vaccine is discovered. The spread of COVID-19 is increasing day by day, imposing human lives and economy at risk. Due to the increased enormity of the number of COVID-19 cases, the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is imperative in the current scenario. AI would be a powerful tool to fight against this pandemic outbreak by predicting the number of cases in advance. Deep learning-based time series techniques are considered to predict world-wide COVID-19 cases in advance for short-term and medium-term dependencies with adaptive learning. Initially, the data pre-processing and feature extraction is made with the real world COVID-19 dataset. Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases, multivariate LSTM models is employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model. From the results, it is evident that the Stacked LSTM algorithm yields higher accuracy with an error of less than 2% as compared to the other considered algorithms for the studied performance metrics. Country-specific analysis and city-specific analysis of COVID-19 cases for India and Chennai, respectively, are predicted and analyzed in detail. Also, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis are done on the COVID-19 datasets by including the features like temperature, rainfall, population, total infected cases, area and population density during the months of May, June, July and August to find out the best suitable model. Further, practical significance of predicting COVID-19 cases is elucidated in terms of assessing pandemic characteristics, scenario planning, optimization of models and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

N2  - <jats:p>Sipuncula, long considered a separate phylum, are now commonly included in the Annelida based on phylogenomic analyses. The sipunculan body consists of an unsegmented trunk and a retractable introvert, usually with a set of tentacles at its anterior end. Unlike other annelids, they have no chaetae, but the introvert is often adorned with proteinaceous hooks that can be important taxonomic characters. Other external taxonomic characters include the tentacles (number, shape and arrangement), body papillae and, in some cases, hardened shields, as well as length ratios. Many species require dissection for correct identification to reveal internal characteristics, such as introvert retractor muscles, nephridia and contractile vessels. Here we summarize the state of the current knowledge of species diversity in sipunculans. We emphasize molecular studies, conducted over the past two decades, that have revealed multiple complexes of cryptic or pseudocryptic species. It has become obvious that diversity is significantly higher than the current taxonomic scheme accounts for, but formal species descriptions are lagging behind. Although the major branches in the sipunculan phylogeny have become increasingly consolidated, the internal relationships within most branches are still in flux.</jats:p>

N2  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 brought the ecology and health of the Gulf of Mexico to the forefront of the public's and scientific community's attention. Not only did we need a better understanding of how this oil spill impacted the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, but we also needed to apply this knowledge to help assess impacts from perturbations in the region and guide future response actions. Phytoplankton represent the base of the food web in oceanic systems. As such, alterations of the phytoplankton community propagate to upper trophic levels. This review brings together new insights into the influence of oil and dispersant on phytoplankton. We bring together laboratory, mesocosm and field experiments, including insights into novel observations of harmful algal bloom (HAB) forming species and zooplankton as well as bacteria-phytoplankton interactions. We finish by addressing knowledge gaps and highlighting key topics for research in novel areas.

N2  - <jats:p>Bioluminescence is widespread throughout the phylum Annelida and occurs in terrestrial and marine lineages. Among marine taxa, bioluminescence has been documented in eight families and anecdotally reported in six additional families. Although new bioluminescent systems have been recently described in annelids, there are still many other families whose light emission mechanisms have not been sufficiently studied. Some of these include luminescent species belonging to the Polynoidae family, also known as scale worms, whose iterations of dorsal elytra (scales) have the ability to emit intense light when stimulated. Depending on the degree of stimulation, some polynoids can autotomize these luminous elytra and posterior segments, which could potentially give them an advantage in evading attacks by predators. It is believed that Polynoidae bioluminescence is associated with a membrane enzyme known as “polynoidin,” which was isolated during the early 1980s from<jats:italic>Malmgrenia lunulata</jats:italic>. However, the characterization and properties of this enzyme, as well as the chemical nature of its substrate or additional potential cofactors, have never been fully described and remain largely unknown. As such, this paper seeks to revisit previous research involving bioluminescence studies in Polynoidae, as well as the morphological, phylogenetic and ecological aspects related to this emission of light.</jats:p>

N2  - In Australia, the deep-water (bathyal and abyssal) benthic invertebrate fauna is poorly known in comparison with that of shallow (subtidal and shelf) habitats. Benthic fauna from the deep eastern Australian margin was sampled systematically for the first time during 2017 RV 'Investigator' voyage 'Sampling the Abyss'. Box core, Brenke sledge, and beam trawl samples were collected at one-degree intervals from Tasmania, 42°S, to southern Queensland, 24°S, from 900 to 4800 m depth. Annelids collected were identified by taxonomic experts on individual families around the world. A complete list of all identified species is presented, accompanied with brief morphological diagnoses, taxonomic remarks, and colour images. A total of more than 6000 annelid specimens consisting of 50 families (47 Polychaeta, one Echiura, two Sipuncula) and 214 species were recovered. Twenty-seven species were given valid names, 45 were assigned the qualifier cf., 87 the qualifier sp., and 55 species were considered new to science. Geographical ranges of 16 morphospecies extended along the eastern Australian margin to the Great Australian Bight, South Australia; however, these ranges need to be confirmed with genetic data. This work providing critical baseline biodiversity data on an important group of benthic invertebrates from a virtually unknown region of the world's ocean will act as a springboard for future taxonomic and biogeographic studies in the area.

N2  - <jats:p>Projected climate change is forecasted to have significant effects on biological systems worldwide. Marine turtles in particular may be vulnerable, as the sex of their offspring is determined by their incubating temperature, termed temperature-dependent sex determination. This study aimed to estimate historical, and forecast future, primary sex ratios of hawksbill turtle <jats:italic>Eretmochelys imbricata</jats:italic> hatchlings at an important nesting ground in northeastern Qatar. Incubation temperatures from the Arabian/Persian Gulf were measured over 2 nesting seasons. Climate data from same period were regressed with nest temperatures to estimate incubation temperatures and hatchling sex ratios for the site from 1993 to 2100. Future hatchling sex ratios were estimated for 2 climate forecasts, one mid-range (SSP245) and one extreme (SSP585). Historical climate data showed female-biased sex ratios of 73.2 ± 12.1% from 1993 to 2017. Female biases from 2018 to 2100 averaged 85.7% ± 6.7% under the mid-range scenario and 87.9% ± 5.4% under the high-range scenario. In addition, predicted female hatchling production was &gt;90% from 2054 and 2052 for SSP245 and SSP585, respectively. These results show that hawksbill primary sex ratios in Qatar are at risk of significant feminization by the year 2100 and that hawksbill turtle incubation temperatures in an extreme, understudied environment are already comparable to those predicted in tropical rookeries during the latter half of the 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> century. These results can help conservationists predict primary sex ratios for hawksbill turtles in the region in the face of 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup>-century climate change.</jats:p>

N2  - Organic particle dynamics in the surface ocean plays a critical part in the marine carbon cycle. Aggregation of marine organic particles drives their downward transport to support various marine organisms on their transit to the sediments. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from various microbes are a major contributor to the oceanic organic particle pool. The stickiness of EPS is expected to play a determining role in the aggregation process of particles; however, stickiness parameters are usually indirectly estimated through data fitting without direct assessment. Here a magnetic tweezer method was developed to quantitatively assess the stickiness of three model EPS produced by: Amphora sp., (diatom), Emiliania huxleyi (coccolithophore), and Sagittula stellata (bacteria), under different in vitro environmental conditions (salinity or EDTA complexed cations) and surface matrices (EPS-EPS and bare glass). Our results showed the stickiness of three microbial EPS decreasing for S. stellata > E. huxleyi > Amphora sp., in line with their decreasing protein-to-carbohydrate (P/C) ratios (related to their relative hydrophobicity). The data not only emphasize the importance of hydrophobicity on EPS stickiness, but also demonstrates that salinity and the nature of the substrate surface can influence the stickiness. Furthermore, we investigated stickiness between various types of EPS, and the observed selective stickiness of EPS between species may shed light on the interactions among heterogeneous marine microorganisms. Overall, this newly developed system provides a platform to assess the EPS stickiness to advance our understanding of the aggregation and sedimentation process of organic particles that are critical for the fate of organic carbon as well as for biofilm formation and microbial colonization of surfaces in the ocean.

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. Pre-disaster planning and mitigation necessitate detailed spatial information about flood hazards and their associated risks. In the US, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) provides important information about areas subject to flooding during the 1 % riverine or coastal event. The binary nature of flood hazard maps obscures the distribution of property risk inside of the SFHA and the residual risk outside of the SFHA, which can undermine mitigation efforts. Machine learning techniques provide an alternative approach to estimating flood hazards across large spatial scales at low computational expense. This study presents a pilot study for the Texas Gulf Coast region using random forest classification to predict flood probability across a 30 523 km2 area. Using a record of National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claims dating back to 1976 and high-resolution geospatial data, we generate a continuous flood hazard map for 12 US Geological Survey (USGS) eight-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watersheds. Results indicate that the random forest model predicts flooding with a high sensitivity (area under the curve, AUC: 0.895), especially compared to the existing FEMA regulatory floodplain. Our model identifies 649 000 structures with at least a 1 % annual chance of flooding, roughly 3 times more than are currently identified by FEMA as flood-prone.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>This paper presents Nyström minimum kernel risk-sensitive loss (NysMKRSL) based control of a three-phase four-wire grid-tied dual-stage PV-hybrid energy storage system, under varying conditions such as irradiation variation, unbalanced load, and abnormal grid voltage. The Voltage Source Converter (VSC) control enables the system to perform multifunctional operations such as reactive power compensation, load balancing, power balancing, and harmonics elimination while maintaining Unity Power Factor (UPF). The proposed VSC control delivers more accurate weights with fewer oscillations, hence reducing overall losses and providing better stability to the system. The seamless control with the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) facilitates the system’s grid-tied and isolated operation. The HESS includes the battery, fuel cell, and ultra-capacitor to accomplish the peak shaving, managing the disturbances of sudden and prolonged nature occurring due to load unbalancing and abnormal grid voltage. The DC link voltage is regulated by tuning the PI controller gains utilizing the Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) algorithm to stabilize the system with minimum deviation from the reference voltage, during various simulated dynamic conditions. The optimized DC bus control generates the accurate loss component of current, which further enhances the performance of the proposed VSC control. The presented system was simulated in the MATLAB 2016a environment and performed satisfactorily as per IEEE 519 standards.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Karst subterranean estuaries (KSEs) are created from the two- and three-way mixing of saline groundwater, rain, and oceanic water in the subsurface on carbonate landscapes, and this hydrographic framework promotes unique physical processes, biogeochemical cycling, and biological communities. Here we provide evidence that the source and quantity of particulate organic matter (POM) that is delivered to the benthos strongly correlates to benthic habitat partitioning in the oxygenated marine sectors of KSEs. A dataset of benthic foraminifera at 128 different locations from several large flooded cave systems in Bermuda were compiled and evaluated against common environmental characteristics (e.g., tidal exposure, substrate particle size, bulk organic matter, C:N, total organic carbon, and δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub>). Benthic areas receiving more carbon isotopically depleted organic matter sources (mean δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> values &amp;lt; −23.2‰, C:N ratios &amp;gt;11), most likely from the terrestrial surface and some marine plankton, were dominated by <jats:italic>Trochammina inflata, Bolivina</jats:italic> spp., and <jats:italic>Helenina anderseni</jats:italic>. In contrast, benthic areas receiving more carbon isotopically enriched organic matter sources (mean δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> values &amp;gt; −21.6‰, C:N ratios &amp;lt;10), most likely from marine plankton transported through marine cave openings cave from adjacent coastal waters, were dominated by <jats:italic>Spirophthalmidium emaciatum, Spirillina vivipara, Patellina corrugata</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Rotaliella arctica</jats:italic>. The benthic foraminifera most distal from any cave entrances were dominated by taxa also known from the deep-sea (e.g., <jats:italic>Rotaliella, Spirophthalmidium</jats:italic>) in sediment with the lowest bulk organic matter content (mean: 6%), or taxa that prefer hard substrates and are potentially living attached to cave walls (<jats:italic>Patellina, Spirillina</jats:italic>). While physical groundwater characteristics (e.g., salinity, dissolved oxygen) are expected drivers of benthic ecosystems in KSEs, these results suggest that POM source, quantity, and delivery mechanisms (e.g., groundwater-seawater circulation mechanisms, terrestrial flux) play an important role in benthic habitat partitioning and the spatial variability of biogeochemical cycles in the oxygenated marine sector of KSEs.</jats:p>

N2  - The first Caribbean settlers were Amerindians from South America. Great Abaco and Grand Bahama, the final islands colonized in the northernmost Bahamas, were inhabited by the Lucayans when Europeans arrived. The timing of Lucayan arrival in the northern Bahamas has been uncertain because direct archaeological evidence is limited. We document Lucayan arrival on Great Abaco Island through a detailed record of vegetation, fire, and landscape dynamics based on proxy data from Blackwood Sinkhole. From about 3,000 to 1,000 y ago, forests dominated by hardwoods and palms were resilient to the effects of hurricanes and cooling sea surface temperatures. The arrival of Lucayans by about 830 CE (2σ range: 720 to 920 CE) is demarcated by increased burning and followed by landscape disturbance and a time-transgressive shift from hardwoods and palms to the modern pine forest. Considering that Lucayan settlements in the southern Bahamian archipelago are dated to about 750 CE (2σ range: 600 to 900 CE), these results demonstrate that Lucayans spread rapidly through the archipelago in less than 100 y. Although precontact landscapes would have been influenced by storms and climatic trends, the most pronounced changes follow more directly from landscape burning and ecosystem shifts after Lucayan arrival. The pine forests of Abaco declined substantially between 1500 and 1670 CE, a period of increased regional hurricane activity, coupled with fires on an already human-impacted landscape. Any future intensification of hurricane activity in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean threatens the sustainability of modern pine forests in the northern Bahamas.

N2  - Element:Ca ratios in the otolith cores of young-of-the-year (YOY) swordfish, Xiphias gladius, were used as natural tracers to predict the nursery origin of subadult and adult swordfish from three foraging grounds in the North Pacific Ocean (NPO). First, the chemistry of otolith cores (proxy for nursery origin) was used to develop nursery-specific elemental signatures in YOY swordfish. Sagittal otoliths of YOY swordfish were collected from four regional nurseries in the NPO between 2000 and 2005: (1) Central Equatorial North Pacific Ocean (CENPO), (2) Central North Pacific Ocean (CNPO), (3) Eastern Equatorial North Pacific Ocean (EENPO) and (4) Western North Pacific Ocean (WNPO). Calcium (43 Ca), magnesium (24 Mg), strontium (88 Sr) and barium (138 Ba) were quantified in the otolith cores of YOY swordfish using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Univariate tests indicated that three element:Ca ratios (Mg:Ca, Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) were significantly different among nurseries. Overall classification success of YOY swordfish to their nursery of collection was 72% based on quadratic discriminant analysis. Next, element:Ca ratios in the otolith cores of subadults and adults collected from three foraging grounds where targeted fisheries exist (Hawaii, California and Mexico) were examined to calculate nursery-specific contribution estimates. Mixed-stock analysis indicated that the CENPO nursery contributed the majority of individuals to all three foraging grounds (Hawaii 45.6 ± 13.2%, California 84.6 ± 10.8% and Mexico 64.5 ± 15.9%). The results from this study highlight the importance of the CENPO nursery and provide researchers and fisheries managers with new information on the connectivity of the swordfish population in the NPO.

N2  - <jats:p> The availability of cost-effective and environmentally friendly electricity to the entire population is a prime concern of the South African government. It has brought attention to microgrid projects, especially when rural population is considered properly. To address the energy needs of any country, the focus line should be the cost and availability of local resources. Due to the abundance of coal reserves and lack of alternative resources, coal dependence cannot be overlooked in the near future. This paper focuses not only on microgrid needs in South Africa but also on the possible use of hydrogen extracted from coal as a fuel in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) in microgrids. The complete assembly of PEMFC and its use in the microgrid are discussed. To make the H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> extraction process eco-friendly and hence worth considering, Carbon capture and sequestration process is discoursed. Furthermore, cost benefit analysis and the long term benefit of the use of PEMFC in microgrids with coal-based hydrogen production are presented in this research. </jats:p>

N2  - <jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Rising flood damages have prompted local communities to implement buyout and property acquisition programmes to eliminate repetitive losses for at-risk properties. However, buyouts are often costly to implement and are reactionary solutions to flooding. This study quantifies the benefits of acquiring vacant private properties in flood-prone areas rather than acquiring such properties after they are built up. Using a geodesign framework that integrates concepts and analytical approaches derived from geographical, spatial and statistical-based disciplines, we analyse vacant properties with high development potential that intersect current and future floodplain areas in Houston (TX, USA). We use geospatial proximity analysis to select candidate properties, land-use prediction modelling to estimate future development and sea-level rise and benefit–cost analysis to assess the economic viability of buyouts. The results indicate that cumulative avoided flood losses exceed the cost of vacant land acquisition by a factor of nearly two to one, and up to a factor of ten to one in selected areas. This study emphasizes the benefits of proactive property buyouts that focus on acquiring parcels before they are built up, while also avoiding the social and institutional problems associated with traditional buyout programmes.</jats:p>

N2  - We tested the hypothesis that mangroves provide better coastal protection than salt marsh vegetation using 10 1,008-m2 plots in which we manipulated mangrove cover from 0 to 100%. Hurricane Harvey passed over the plots in 2017. Data from erosion stakes indicated up to 26 cm of vertical and 970 cm of horizontal erosion over 70 months in the plot with 0% mangrove cover, but relatively little erosion in other plots. The hurricane did not increase erosion, and erosion decreased after the hurricane passed. Data from drone images indicated 196 m2 of erosion in the 0% mangrove plot, relatively little erosion in other plots, and little ongoing erosion after the hurricane. Transects through the plots indicated that the levee (near the front of the plot) and the bank (the front edge of the plot) retreated up to 9 m as a continuous function of decreasing mangrove cover. Soil strength was greater in areas vegetated with mangroves than in areas vegetated by marsh plants, or nonvegetated areas, and increased as a function of plot-level mangrove cover. Mangroves prevented erosion better than marsh plants did, but this service was nonlinear, with low mangrove cover providing most of the benefits.

N2  - <jats:p>The attractive features of the direct AC-AC converters increase their use in many applications such as voltage control for a heavy-duty load that has a high time constant, AC machine drives, and heating systems based on the induction process. These converters process power in single-stage having simple circuit topologies with reduced switching devices and circuit components. These characteristics lead to the efficient power conversion process. The use of a low-frequency input transformer with multiple output tapping for the regulation of output voltage and frequency is one of the major sources of cost, size, and conversion losses. The complication in the switching algorithms is also the main concern in these converters. The preceding deficiencies lower their potency to be used in daily life. The costly controllers or processors are to be employed to realize the complex control techniques or algorithms. That increases the overall cost and circuit complication. This paper introduces the simple control techniques employed to a novel transformer less multi converter to have the various ac outputs for voltage and frequency regulation. The validation of power circuit and control schemes is tested through the simulation and practical results obtained in Simulink and practical setup respectively.</jats:p>

N2  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator (CDA) were originally discovered in deep fracture fluids accessed via South African gold mines and have since been found in geographically widespread deep subsurface locations. In order to constrain models for subsurface microbial evolution, we compared CDA genomes from Africa, North America and Eurasia using single cell genomics. Unexpectedly, 126 partial single amplified genomes from the three continents, a complete genome from of an isolate from Eurasia, and metagenome-assembled genomes from Africa and Eurasia shared >99.2% average nucleotide identity, low frequency of SNP's, and near-perfectly conserved prophages and CRISPRs. Our analyses reject sample cross-contamination, recent natural dispersal, and unusually strong purifying selection as likely explanations for these unexpected results. We therefore conclude that the analyzed CDA populations underwent only minimal evolution since their physical separation, potentially as far back as the breakup of Pangea between 165 and 55 Ma ago. High-fidelity DNA replication and repair mechanisms are the most plausible explanation for the highly conserved genome of CDA. CDA presents a stark contrast to the current model organisms in microbial evolutionary studies, which often develop adaptive traits over far shorter periods of time.

N2  - <jats:p>Abstract. The MALINA oceanographic campaign was conducted during summer 2009 to investigate the carbon stocks and the processes controlling the carbon fluxes in the Mackenzie River estuary and the Beaufort Sea. During the campaign, an extensive suite of physical, chemical and biological variables were measured across seven shelf–basin transects (south–north) to capture the meridional gradient between the estuary and the open ocean. Key variables such as temperature, absolute salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, and carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured onboard the Canadian research icebreaker CCGS Amundsen and from a barge in shallow coastal areas or for sampling within broken ice fields. Here, we present the results of a joint effort to compile and standardize the collected data sets that will facilitate their reuse in further studies of the changing Arctic Ocean. The data set is available at https://doi.org/10.17882/75345 (Massicotte et al., 2020).

N2  - <jats:p>The power quality of the Electrical Power System (EPS) is greatly affected by electrical harmonics. Hence, accurate and proper estimation of electrical harmonics is essential to design appropriate filters for mitigation of harmonics and their associated effects on the power quality of EPS. This paper presents a novel statistical (Least Square) and meta-heuristic (Grey wolf optimizer) based hybrid technique for accurate detection and estimation of electrical harmonics with minimum computational time. The non-linear part (phase and frequency) of harmonics is estimated using GWO, while the linear part (amplitude) is estimated using the LS method. Furthermore, harmonics having transients are also estimated using proposed harmonic estimators. The effectiveness of the proposed harmonic estimator is evaluated using various case studies. Comparing the proposed approach with other harmonic estimation techniques demonstrates that it has a minimum mean square error with less complexity and better computational efficiency.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is the largest in US history in terms of oil released and the amount of dispersants applied. It is also the first spill in which the incorporation of oil and/or dispersant into marine snow was directly observable. Marine snow formation, incorporation of oil (MOS – marine oil snow) and subsequent settling to the seafloor, has been termed MOSSFA: Marine Oil Snow Sedimentation and Flocculent Accumulation. This pathway accounts for a significant fraction of the total oil returning back to the sea floor. GOMRI funded studies have determined that important drivers of MOSSFA include, but are not limited to, an elevated and extended Mississippi River discharge, which enhanced phytoplankton production and suspended particle concentrations, zooplankton grazing, and enhanced mucus formation (operationally defined as EPS, TEP, marine snow). Efforts thus far to understand the mechanisms driving these processes are being used to aid in the development of response strategies. These include modeling efforts towards predicting plume dynamics. Although much has been learned during the GOMRI program (reviewed herein and elsewhere), there are still important unknowns that need to be addressed. Understanding of the conditions under which significant MOSSFA events occur, the consequences to the biology, the sinking velocity and distribution of the MOSSFA as well as its ultimate fate are amongst the most important consideration for future studies. Also important is the modification of the oil and dispersant within the MOS and its transport as part of MOSSFA. Ongoing studies are needed to further develop our understanding of these complex and interrelated phenomena.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Subsurface mixing of seawater and terrestrial-borne meteoric waters on carbonate landscapes creates karst subterranean estuaries, an area of the coastal aquifer with poorly understood carbon cycling, ecosystem functioning, and impact on submarine groundwater discharge. Caves in karst platforms facilitate water and material exchange between the marine and terrestrial environments, and their internal sedimentation patterns document long-term environmental change. Sediment records from a flooded coastal cave in Cozumel Island (Mexico) document decreasing terrestrial organic matter (OM) deposition within the karst subterranean estuary over the last ∼1,000 years, with older sediment likely exported out of the cave by intense storm events. While stable carbon isotopic values (δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> ranging from −22.5 to −27.1‰) and C:N ratios (ranging from 9.9 to 18.9) indicate that mangrove and other terrestrial detritus surrounding an inland sinkhole are the primarily sedimentary OM supply, an upcore decrease in bulk OM and enrichment of δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> values are observed. These patterns suggest that a reduction in the local mangrove habitat decreased the terrestrial particulate OM input to the cave over time. The benthic foraminiferal community in basal core sediment have higher proportions of infaunal taxa (i.e., <jats:italic>Bolivina</jats:italic>) and <jats:italic>Ammonia</jats:italic>, and assemblages shift to increased miliolids and less infaunal taxa at the core-top sediment. The combined results suggest that a decrease in terrestrial OM through time had a concomitant impact on benthic meiofaunal habitats, potentially by impacting dissolved oxygen availability at the microhabitat scale or resource partitioning by foraminifera. The evidence presented here indicates that landscape and watershed level changes can impact ecosystem functioning within adjacent subterranean estuaries.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>The efficiency of PV systems can be improved by accurate estimation of PV parameters. Parameter estimation of PV cells and modules is a challenging task as it requires accurate operation of PV cells and modules followed by an optimization tool that estimates their associated parameters. Mostly, population-based optimization tools are utilized for PV parameter estimation problems due to their computational intelligent behavior. However, most of them suffer from premature convergence problems, high computational burden, and often fall into local optimum solution. To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents an improved variant of particle swarm optimization (PSO) aiming to reduce shortcomings offered by conventional PSO for estimation of PV parameters. PSO is improved by introducing two strategies to control inertia weight and acceleration coefficients. At first, a sine chaotic inertia weight strategy is employed to attain an appropriate balance between local and global search. Afterward, a tangent chaotic strategy is utilized to guide acceleration coefficients in search of an optimal solution. The proposed algorithm is utilized to estimate the parameters of the PWP201 PV module, RTC France solar cell, and a JKM330P-72 PV module-based practical system. The obtained results indicate that the proposed technique avoids premature convergence and local optima stagnation of conventional PSO. Moreover, a comparison of obtained results with techniques available in the literature proves that the proposed methodology is an efficient, effective, and optimal tool to estimate PV modules and cells’ parameters.</jats:p>

N2  - CPI-613 is a mitochondrial metabolism disrupter that inhibits tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. The consequences of TCA cycle disruption on various metabolic pathways and overall organismal physiology are not fully known. The present study integrates in vivo experimental data with an in silico stoichiometric metabolism model of zebrafish to study the metabolic pathways perturbed under CPI-613 exposure. Embryo-larval life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 1 μM CPI-613 for 20 days. Whole-organism respirometry measurements showed an initial suppression of O2 consumption at Day 5 of exposure, followed by recovery comparable to the solvent control (0.01% DMSO) by Day 20. Comparison of whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing at Day 5 vs. 20 of exposure showed functional categories related to O2 binding and transport, antioxidant activity, FAD binding, and hemoglobin complexes, to be commonly represented. Metabolic enzyme gene expression changes and O2 consumption rate was used to parametrize two in silico stoichiometric metabolic models representative of Day 5 or 20 of exposure. Computational simulations predicted impaired ATP synthesis, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) activity, and fatty acid β-oxidation at Day 5 vs. 20 of exposure. These results show that the targeted disruption of KGDH may also impact oxidative phosphorylation (ATP synthesis) and fatty acid metabolism (β-oxidation), in turn influencing cellular bioenergetics and the observed reduction in whole-organism O2 consumption rate. The results of this study provide an integrated in vivo and in silico framework to study the impacts of metabolic disruption on organismal physiology.

N2  - Climate models predict an increase in extent, frequency, and duration of marine hypoxia events in the twenty first century. A better understanding of organismal responses to hypoxia in individual species is a crucial step for predicting ecosystem responses. We experimentally subjected a common invertebrate, the bearded fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) to two levels of chronic hypoxia and, in a separate experiment, to intermittent hypoxia. We found components of the conserved hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway and show a modulated response to hypoxia depending on the severity of hypoxic stress: under mild hypoxia, only the HIF-1α subunit is upregulated, while expression of the other subunit, aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translator, only increases significantly at more severe hypoxia levels. The chronic trials revealed down-regulation of genes related to cell adhesion, transport, development and heme-binding, and up-regulation of genes related to glycolysis, oxygen binding, cell differentiation, digestive and reproductive function. The intermittent hypoxia trials revealed an upregulation of heme transporter activity during hypoxia, and our time series analysis characterized nine clusters of genes with similar expression patterns. Our findings suggest that H. carunculata is likely to tolerate, and be resilient to, predicted future hypoxia conditions.

N2  - <jats:p>Remipedia is a stygobitic group commonly associated with coastal anchialine caves. This class consists of 12 genera, ten of which are found within the Lucayan Archipelago. Herein, we describe a new species within the genus Godzillius from Conch Sound Blue Hole, North Andros Island, Bahamas. Godzillius louriei sp. nov. is the third known remipede observed from a subseafloor marine cave, and the first from the Godzilliidae. Remipedes dwell within notoriously difficult to access cave habitats and thus integrative and comprehensive systematic studies at family or genus level are often absent in the literature. In this study, all species of Godzillius are compared using morphological and molecular approaches. Specifically, the feeding appendages of G. louriei sp. nov., G. fuchsi Gonzalez, Singpiel &amp; Schlagner, 2013 and G. robustus Schram, Yager &amp; Emerson, 1986 were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Species of Godzillius are identified based on the spines of maxilla 1 segment 4 and by the denticles on the lacinia mobilis of the left mandible. A molecular phylogeny using the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and nuclear histone 3 genes recovered G. louriei sp. nov. within the Godzillius clade and 16S genetic distances revealed a 13–15% difference between species of Godzillius.</jats:p>

N2  - The hypothesis that biotic interactions strengthen toward lower latitudes provides a framework for linking community-scale processes with the macroecological scales that define our biosphere. Despite the importance of this hypothesis for understanding community assembly and ecosystem functioning, the extent to which interaction strength varies across latitude and the effects of this variation on natural communities remain unresolved. Predation in particular is central to ecological and evolutionary dynamics across the globe, yet very few studies explore both community-scale causes and outcomes of predation across latitude. Here we expand beyond prior studies to examine two important components of predation strength: intensity of predation (including multiple dimensions of the predator guild) and impact on prey community biomass and structure, providing one of the most comprehensive examinations of predator-prey interactions across latitude. Using standardized experiments, we tested the hypothesis that predation intensity and impact on prey communities were stronger at lower latitudes. We further assessed prey recruitment to evaluate the potential for this process to mediate predation effects. We used sessile marine invertebrate communities and their fish predators in nearshore environments as a model system, with experiments conducted at 12 sites in four regions spanning the tropics to the subarctic. Our results show clear support for an increase in both predation intensity and impact at lower relative to higher latitudes. The predator guild was more diverse at low latitudes, with higher predation rates, longer interaction durations, and larger predator body sizes, suggesting stronger predation intensity in the tropics. Predation also reduced prey biomass and altered prey composition at low latitudes, with no effects at high latitudes. Although recruitment rates were up to three orders of magnitude higher in the tropics than the subarctic, prey replacement through this process was insufficient to dampen completely the strong impacts of predators in the tropics. Our study provides a novel perspective on the biotic interaction hypothesis, suggesting that multiple components of the predator community likely contribute to predation intensity at low latitudes, with important consequences for the structure of prey communities.

N2  - <jats:p>Through a combination of selective extractions and molecular characterization techniques including Isoelectric Focusing Chromatography and Electrospray Ionization Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass spectrometry, molecular structures of diatom (<jats:italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</jats:italic>) and coccolithophore (<jats:italic>Emiliania huxleyi</jats:italic>)-associated biopolymers that are responsible for the distinct partitioning behavior between <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb and <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po were determined. Our results show that diatom-derived biopolymers have distinctive elemental grouping distributions as compared to those excreted by the coccolithophore, with the former consisting of more heterogeneous elements (i.e., nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus-containing organic compounds). For the coccolithophore culture, two <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb-enriched biopolymers (non-attached exopolymeric substances and coccosphere shell-associated biopolymers) have a higher abundance of CHO-type compounds, suggesting CHO-only-type compounds as the main binding moieties for <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb. In contrast, such association was not evident in the diatom culture. Different with <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb, <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po enrichment in coccolithophore-derived attached exopolymeric substances and Fe-Mn-associated metabolites coincided with the higher abundance of nitrogen/sulfur-containing organic compounds in these two biopolymer fractions, suggesting the strong parallel of Po with the production of nitrogen-rich organic matter as well as sulfur-containing amino acids. These different associations between <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb/<jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po and organic functional groups were further explored by separating <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb or <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po-labeled coccolithophore-derived biopolymers <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> isoelectric focusing. This technique suggests that phosphate group-containing molecules but not the other molecules that contain heterogeneous elements (e.g., CHONS, CHON, and CHOS) as the strongest binding agents for <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb, while the more hydrophobic (high protein to carbohydrate ratio) nitrogen/sulfur-enriched organic moieties acted as the main <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po-binding ligands. It is concluded that the deficiency of <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po with respect to <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb can be influenced by the relative abundance of nitrogen/sulfur-enriched organic moieties to the nitrogen/sulfur-depleted organic compounds in the water column. This behavior constrains the application of <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po-<jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb approach to quantify the particulate organic carbon (POC) export flux in the ocean. It also explains that differences in chemical binding of the <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po as compared to those of other radionuclides (e.g., thorium-234) as the main factor. That suggests that differences in decay half-lives or physical factors are less important when these nuclides are applied to estimate the POC flux in the ocean.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>The development of offshore wind farms (WF) is inevitable as they have exceptional resistance against climate change and produce clean energy without hazardous wastes. The offshore WF usually has a bigger generation capacity with less environmental impacts, and it is more reliable too due to stronger and consistent sea winds. The early offshore WF installations are located near the shore, whereas most modern installations are located far away from shore, generating higher power. This paradigm shift has forced the researchers and industry personnel to look deeper into transmission options, namely, high voltage AC transmission (HVAC) and high voltage DC transmission (HVDC). This evaluation can be both in terms of power carrying capability as well as cost comparisons. Additionally, different performance requirements such as power rating, onshore grid requirements, reactive power compensation, etc., must be considered for evaluation. This paper elaborately reviews and explains the offshore wind farm structure and performance requirements for bulk offshore power transfer. Based on the structure and performance requirements, both HVDC and HVAC transmission modes are compared and analyzed critically. Finally, a criterion for selection and increasing popularity of HVDC transmission is established.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Subtropical estuaries often experience seasonal climatic shifts, which influence environmental conditions such as water temperature and salinity. The distribution of estuarine organisms depends on the availability of suitable environmental conditions, the extent of which may differ across seasons. Furthermore, ecological interactions among organisms, such as predation and competition, often occur when multiple species overlap spatiotemporally and can influence their distributions and abundances. Determining the habitat associations and overlap patterns among predator and prey species across seasons can thus enhance our understanding of ecosystem function. This study used a long-term monitoring data set to examine the habitat suitability and overlap patterns between 4 predator and 4 prey species in a northwestern Gulf of Mexico estuary. Seasonal (fall and spring) habitat suitability models and maps were created, which allowed for delineation of spatiotemporal overlap between predators and prey. Environmental drivers of habitat suitability differed among species, but temperature and salinity were frequently the most important variables. Seasonal differences in habitat suitability were observed for all species, but these differences were more notable for prey than for predators. Seasonality in habitat suitability was likely driven primarily by seasonal changes in environmental conditions and movements related to reproductive activities. Spatiotemporal overlap between predators and prey was observed primarily in whichever season each prey species was more abundant and in regions where highly suitable habitat was most ubiquitous for each predator. These results suggest that overlap between these predators and prey is highly seasonal, implying seasonality in the diets of predators and predation pressure on prey.</jats:p>

N2  - Microgels play critical roles in a variety of processes in the ocean, including element cycling, particle interactions, microbial ecology, food web dynamics, air-sea exchange, and pollutant distribution and transport. Exopolymeric substances (EPS) from various marine microbes are one of the major sources for marine microgels. Due to their amphiphilic nature, many types of pollutants, especially hydrophobic ones, have been found to preferentially associate with marine microgels. The interactions between pollutants and microgels can significantly impact the transport, sedimentation, distribution, and the ultimate fate of these pollutants in the ocean. This review on marine gels focuses on the discussion of the interactions between gel-forming EPS and pollutants, such as oil and other hydrophobic pollutants, nanoparticles, and metal ions.

N2  - Only few genes are known from insects that encode multiple neuropeptides, i.e., peptides that activate different receptors. Among those are the capa and pk genes, which differentiated within Hexapoda following gene duplication. In our study, we focus on the early stages of differentiation of these genes. Specifically: (1) What was the expression pattern of the ancestral capa/pk gene, i.e., prior to gene duplication? (2) What is the expression pattern of capa and pk in silverfish, whose ancestors diverged from Pterygota more than 400 mya? Our results suggest the location and projection of CAPA immunoreactive Va cells in abdominal ganglia (trunk ganglia in Remipedia) are a plesiomorphic trait that was already present in the ancestor of Remipedia and Hexapoda. General features of serial homology such as location of cells bodies, contralateral projection of primary neurites, and presumed peripheral peptide release from segmentally arranged neurohemal release sites could be observed in Remipedia and silverfish, but also in all Pterygota studied so far. Differences are mainly in the specific location of these peripheral release sites. This hypothetical basic pattern of capa/pk neurons underwent modifications in the anterior ganglia of the ventral nerve cord already in Remipedia. In silverfish, as in all Pterygota studied so far, pk expression in the CNS is apparently restricted to the gnathal ganglia, whereas capa expression is typical of abdominal Va cells. Thus, differentiation in the expression pattern of capa and pk genes occurred early in the evolution of Hexapoda; likely soon after the appearance of two separate genes.

N2  - Geochemical chronologies were constructed from otoliths of adult Pacific bluefin tuna (PBT) to investigate the timing of age-specific egress of juveniles from coastal nurseries in the East China Sea or Sea of Japan to offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. Element:Ca chronologies were developed for otolith Li, Mg, Mn, Zn, Sr, and Ba, and our assessment focused on the section of the otolith corresponding to the age-0 to age-1 + interval. Next, we applied a common time-series approach to geochemical profiles to identify divergences presumably linked to inshore-offshore migrations. Conspicuous geochemical shifts were detected during the juvenile interval for Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, and Sr:Ca that were indicative of coastal-offshore transitions or egress generally occurring for individuals approximately 4-6 mo. old, with later departures (6 mo. or older) linked to overwintering being more limited. Changepoints in otolith Ba:Ca profiles were most common in the early age-1 period (ca. 12-16 mo.) and appear associated with entry into upwelling areas such as the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem following trans-Pacific migrations. Natal origin of PBT was also predicted using the early life portion of geochemical profile in relation to a baseline sample comprised of age-0 PBT from the two primary spawning areas in the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Mixed-stock analysis indicated that the majority (66%) of adult PBT in our sample originated from the East China Sea, but individuals of Sea of Japan origin were also detected in the Ryukyu Archipelago.

N2  - Basal metabolic rate generally scales with body mass in mammals, and variation from predicted levels indicates adaptive metabolic remodeling. As a thermogenic adaptation for living in cool water, sea otters have a basal metabolic rate approximately three times that of the predicted rate; however, the tissue-level source of this hypermetabolism is unknown. Because skeletal muscle is a major determinant of whole-body metabolism, we characterized respiratory capacity and thermogenic leak in sea otter muscle. Compared with that of previously sampled mammals, thermogenic muscle leak capacity was elevated and could account for sea otter hypermetabolism. Muscle respiratory capacity was modestly elevated and reached adult levels in neonates. Premature metabolic development and high leak rate indicate that sea otter muscle metabolism is regulated by thermogenic demand and is the source of basal hypermetabolism.

                  <jats:p>Studies of competition in mangroves are mostly limited to seedlings and artificial settings like forestry projects.

                  <jats:p>We conducted a study near Port Aransas, Texas, USA, which is near the geographical limit of mangroves and dominated by monospecific stands of “scrub” form black mangroves, Avicennia germinans. We thinned ten plots to create a gradient of mangrove cover, and quantified the effects of mangrove cover on the growth of tagged mangroves from 2013 to 2019, and the mangrove canopy height in 2019.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>Important Findings</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>The relative growth rate of tagged mangroves declined as mangrove cover increased, and plants in the plot with 100% mangrove cover did not grow, indicating that they had attained their maximum size. In plots with reduced mangrove cover, plant height increased sharply, with plants in the plot with 11% mangrove cover growing ~ 52% taller over six years. Canopy height was ~ 30% taller in the plot fringe than in the interior, and canopy height in both fringe and interior declined as mangrove cover increased. Measures of leaf chlorophyll concentration and light interception suggested that plants were primarily limited by nitrogen. Our results showed that scrub mangroves compete strongly despite being limited by abiotic conditions, and that the importance of competition was greater in magnitude than that of abiotic differences between the fringe and interior.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Microbes (bacteria, phytoplankton) in the ocean are responsible for the copious production of exopolymeric substances (EPS) that include transparent exopolymeric particles. These materials act as a matrix to form marine snow. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, marine oil snow (MOS) formed in massive quantities and influenced the fate and transport of oil in the ocean. The processes and pathways of MOS formation require further elucidation to be better understood, in particular we need to better understand how dispersants affect aggregation and degradation of oil. Toward that end, recent work has characterized EPS as a function of microbial community and environmental conditions. We present a conceptual model that incorporates recent findings in our understanding of the driving forces of MOS sedimentation and flocculent accumulation (MOSSFA) including factors that influence the scavenging of oil into MOS and the routes that promote decomposition of the oil post MOS formation. In particular, the model incorporates advances in our understanding of processes that control interactions between oil, dispersant, and EPS in producing either MOS that can sink or dispersed gels promoting microbial degradation of oil compounds. A critical element is the role of protein to carbohydrate ratios (P/C ratios) of EPS in the aggregation process of colloid and particle formation. The P/C ratio of EPS provides a chemical basis for the “stickiness” factor that is used in analytical or numerical simulations of the aggregation process. This factor also provides a relative measure for the strength of attachment of EPS to particle surfaces. Results from recent laboratory experiments demonstrate (i) the rapid formation of microbial assemblages, including their EPS, on oil droplets that is enhanced in the presence of Corexit-dispersed oil, and (ii) the subsequent rapid oil oxidation and microbial degradation in water. These findings, combined with the conceptual model, further improve our understanding of the fate of the sinking MOS (e.g., subsequent sedimentation and preservation/degradation) and expand our ability to predict the behavior and transport of spilled oil in the ocean, and the potential effects of Corexit application, specifically with respect to MOS processes (i.e., formation, fate, and half-lives) and Marine Oil Snow Sedimentation and Flocculent Accumulation.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>This paper presents a novel, scalable, and modular multiport power electronic topology for the integration of multiple resources. This converter is not only scalable in terms of the integration of multiple renewable energy resources (RES) and storage devices (SDs) but is also scalable in terms of output ports. Multiple dc outputs of a converter are designed to serve as input to the stacking modules (SMs) of the modular multilevel converter (MMC). The proposed multiport converter is bidirectional in nature and superior in terms of functionality in a way that a modular universal converter is responsible for the integration of multiple RES/SDs and regulates multiple dc output ports for SMs of MMC. All input ports can be easily integrated (and controlled), and output ports also can be controlled independently in response to any load variations. An isolated active half-bridge converter with multiple secondaries acts as a central hub for power processing with multiple renewable energy resources that are integrated at the primary side. To verify the proposed converter, a detailed design of the converter-based system is presented along with the proposed control algorithm for managing power on the individual component level. Additionally, different modes of power management (emulating the availability/variability of renewable energy sources (RES)) are exhibited and analyzed here. Finally, detailed simulation results are presented in detail for the validation of the proposed concepts and design process.</jats:p>

N2  - American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) inhabit freshwater wetlands that are vulnerable to salinization caused by anthropogenic alterations to freshwater flow, in addition to storm surges, sea level rise, and droughts. Salinization of coastal freshwater habitats is a growing concern in a changing climate due to increased frequency and intensity of storm surges and drought conditions. This study opportunistically sampled juvenile male and female wild alligators in various salinities each month excluding November, December, and January for one year at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in coastal Louisiana. Blood plasma biochemistry parameters including electrolyte levels were subsequently measured. In addition, levels of various renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones, glucocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestogens were analyzed using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Only males were sampled in hyperosmotic environments (> 10‰) during dry conditions in late summer 2018. In juvenile males, plasma Na+, Cl-, and the progestogen 17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone were significantly and positively correlated with environmental salinity. However, variation in glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens were not associated with hypersaline water while sex steroids showed significant seasonal variation. This study demonstrated significant correlation of environmental salinity with electrolyte levels and a sex steroid in wild juvenile alligators, and to our knowledge represents the first measurement of 17α,20β-dihydroxypregnenone in alligators.

Shark diets were dominated by fish prey taxa [&amp;gt;98% index of relative importance (%IRI)], and of those identified to the family level, two families comprised greater than 50% IRI, Mugilidae (mullets: ∼32%) and Sciaenidae (drums and croakers: 27%). Clupeidae (herrings: 14%) and Ariidae (sea catfishes: 15%) also contributed substantially to the diet of juvenile sharks, though consumption of Ariidae increased as consumption of Clupeidae decreased in juvenile sharks larger than 893 mm Fork Length (FL) (∼1 year old). Values of δ<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N increased significantly with shark size, indicating a shift toward larger or higher trophic level prey with increasing shark size. Latitudinal and temporal trends in δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C and δ<jats:sup>34</jats:sup>S suggest isotopic variation occurred in correspondence with shifts in primary producer assemblages and environmental drivers of sampled estuaries.

N2  - <jats:p>Bermuda is an Eocene age volcanic island in the western North Atlantic, entirely capped by Pleistocene eolian limestone. The oldest and most highly karstified limestone is a 2 km2 outcrop of the Walsingham Formation containing most of the island’s 150+ caves. Extensive networks of submerged cave passageways, flooded by saltwater, extend under the island. In the early 1980s, cave divers initially discovered an exceptionally rich and diverse anchialine community inhabiting deeper sections of the caves. The fauna inhabiting caves in the Walsingham Tract consists of 78 described species of cave-dwelling invertebrates, including 63 stygobionts and 15 stygophiles. Thus, it represents one of the world’s top hotspots of subterranean biodiversity. Of the anchialine fauna, 65 of the 78 species are endemic to Bermuda, while 66 of the 78 are crustaceans. The majority of the cave species are limited in their distribution to just one or only a few adjacent caves. Due to Bermuda’s high population density, water pollution, construction, limestone quarries, and trash dumping produce severe pressures on cave fauna and groundwater health. Consequently, the IUCN Red List includes 25 of Bermuda’s stygobiont species as critically endangered.</jats:p>

N2  - Modern smart grid systems are heavily dependent on Information and
Communication Technology, and this dependency makes them prone to cyberattacks.
The occurrence of a cyberattack has increased in recent years resulting in
substantial damage to power systems. For a reliable and stable operation, cyber
protection, control, and detection techniques are becoming essential. Automated
detection of cyberattacks with high accuracy is a challenge. To address this,
we propose a two-layer hierarchical machine learning model having an accuracy
of 95.44 % to improve the detection of cyberattacks. The first layer of the
model is used to distinguish between the two modes of operation (normal state
or cyberattack). The second layer is used to classify the state into different
types of cyberattacks. The layered approach provides an opportunity for the
model to focus its training on the targeted task of the layer, resulting in
improvement in model accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
model, we compared its performance against other recent cyber attack detection
models proposed in the literature.

N2  - Management of gases during diving is not well understood across marine mammal species. Prior to diving, phocid (true) seals generally exhale, a behaviour thought to assist with the prevention of decompression sickness. Otariid seals (fur seals and sea lions) have a greater reliance on their lung oxygen stores, and inhale prior to diving. One otariid, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), then exhales during the final 50-85% of the return to the surface, which may prevent another gas management issue: shallow-water blackout. Here, we compare data collected from animal-attached tags (video cameras, hydrophones and conductivity sensors) deployed on a suite of otariid seal species to examine the ubiquity of ascent exhalations for this group. We find evidence for ascent exhalations across four fur seal species, but that such exhalations are absent for three sea lion species. Fur seals and sea lions are no longer genetically separated into distinct subfamilies, but are morphologically distinguished by the thick underfur layer of fur seals. Together with their smaller size and energetic dives, we suggest their air-filled fur might underlie the need to perform these exhalations, although whether to reduce buoyancy and ascent speed, for the avoidance of shallow-water blackout or to prevent other cardiovascular management issues in their diving remains unclear. This article is part of the theme issue 'Measuring physiology in free-living animals (Part I)'.

N2  - <jats:p>Microbial interactions influence nearly one-half of the global biogeochemical flux of major elements of the marine ecosystem. Despite their ecological importance, microbial interactions remain poorly understood and even less is known regarding the effects of anthropogenic perturbations on these microbial interactions. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill exposed the Gulf of Mexico to ∼4.9 million barrels of crude oil over 87 days. We determined the effects of oil exposure on microbial interactions using short- and long-term microcosm experiments with and without Macondo surrogate oil. Microbial activity determined using radiotracers revealed that oil exposure negatively affected substrate uptake by prokaryotes within 8 h and by eukaryotes over 72 h. Eukaryotic uptake of heterotrophic exopolymeric substances (EPS) was more severely affected than prokaryotic uptake of phototrophic EPS. In addition, our long-term exposure study showed severe effects on photosynthetic activity. Lastly, changes in microbial relative abundances and fewer co-occurrences among microbial species were mostly driven by photosynthetic activity, treatment (control vs. oil), and prokaryotic heterotrophic metabolism. Overall, oil exposure affected microbial co-occurrence and/or interactions possibly by direct reduction in abundance of one of the interacting community members and/or indirect by reduction in metabolism (substrate uptake or photosynthesis) of interacting members.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>As predators, coastal and oceanic sharks play critical roles in shaping ecosystem structure and function, but most shark species are highly susceptible to population declines. Effective management of vulnerable shark populations requires knowledge of species-specific movement and habitat use patterns. Since sharks are often highly mobile and long-lived, tracking their habitat use patterns over large spatiotemporal scales is challenging. However, the analysis of elemental tracers in vertebral cartilage can describe a continuous record of the life history of an individual from birth to death. This study examined trace elements (Li, Mg, Mn, Zn, Sr, and Ba) along vertebral transects of five shark species with unique life histories. From most freshwater-associated to most oceanic, these species include Bull Sharks (<jats:italic>Carcharhinus leucas</jats:italic>), Bonnethead Sharks (<jats:italic>Sphyrna tiburo</jats:italic>), Blacktip Sharks (<jats:italic>Carcharhinus limbatus</jats:italic>), Spinner Sharks (<jats:italic>Carcharhinus brevipinna</jats:italic>), and Shortfin Mako Sharks (<jats:italic>Isurus oxyrinchus</jats:italic>). Element concentrations were compared across life stages (young-of-the-year, early juvenile, late juvenile, and adult) to infer species-specific ontogenetic patterns of habitat use and movement. Many of the observed elemental patterns could be explained by known life history traits: <jats:italic>C. leucas</jats:italic> exhibited clear ontogenetic changes in elemental composition matching expected changes in their use of freshwater habitats over time. <jats:italic>S. tiburo</jats:italic> elemental composition did not differ across ontogeny, suggesting residence in estuarine/coastal regions. The patterns of elemental composition were strikingly similar between <jats:italic>C. brevipinna</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>C. limbatus</jats:italic>, suggesting they co-occur in similar habitats across ontogeny. <jats:italic>I. oxyrinchus</jats:italic> elemental composition was stable over time, but some ontogenetic shifts occurred that may be due to changes in migration patterns with maturation. The results presented in this study enhance our understanding of the habitat use and movement patterns of coastal and oceanic sharks, and highlights the applicability of vertebral chemistry as a tool for characterizing shark life history traits.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Marine gels (nano-, micro-, macro-) and marine snow play important roles in regulating global and basin-scale ocean biogeochemical cycling. Exopolymeric substances (EPS) including transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) that form from nano-gel precursors are abundant materials in the ocean, accounting for an estimated 700 Gt of carbon in seawater. This supports local microbial communities that play a critical role in the cycling of carbon and other macro- and micro-elements in the ocean. Recent studies have furthered our understanding of the formation and properties of these materials, but the relationship between the microbial polymers released into the ocean and marine snow remains unclear. Recent studies suggest developing a (relatively) simple model that is tractable and related to the available data will enable us to step forward into new research by following marine snow formation under different conditions. In this review, we synthesize the chemical and physical processes. We emphasize where these connections may lead to a predictive, mechanistic understanding of the role of gels in marine snow formation and the biogeochemical functioning of the ocean.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Critical infrastructures (e.g., energy and transportation systems) are essential lifelines for most modern sectors and have utmost significance in our daily lives. However, these important domains can fail to operate due to system failures or natural disasters. Though the major disturbances in such critical infrastructures are rare, the severity of such events calls for the development of effective resilience assessment strategies to mitigate relative losses. Traditional critical infrastructure resilience approaches consider that the available critical infrastructure agents are resource-sufficient and agree to exchange local data with the server and other agents. Such assumptions create two issues: (1) uncertainty in reaching convergence while applying learning strategies on resource-constrained critical infrastructure agents, and (2) a huge risk of privacy leakage. By understanding the pressing need to construct an effective resilience model for resource-constrained critical infrastructure, this paper aims at leveraging a distributed machine learning technique called Federated Learning (FL) to tackle an agent’s resource limitations effectively and at the same time keep the agent’s information private. Particularly, this paper is focused on predicting the probable outage and resource status of critical infrastructure agents without sharing any local data and carrying out the learning process even when most of the agents are incapable of accomplishing a given computational task. To that end, an FL algorithm is designed specifically for a resource-constrained critical infrastructure environment that could facilitate the training of each agent in a distributed fashion, restrict them from sharing their raw data with any other external entities (e.g., server, neighbor agents), choose proficient clients by analyzing their resources, and allow a partial amount of computation tasks to be performed by the resource-constrained agents. We considered a different number of agents with various stragglers and checked the performance of FedAvg and our proposed FedResilience algorithm with prediction tasks for a probable outage, as well as checking the agents’ resource-sharing scope. Our simulation results show that if the majority of the FL agents are stragglers and we drop them from the training process, then the agents learn very slowly and the overall model performance is negatively affected. We also demonstrate that the selection of proficient agents and allowing them to complete only parts of their tasks can significantly improve the knowledge of each agent by eliminating the straggler effects, and the global model convergence is accelerated.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Black mangroves <jats:italic>Avicennia germinans</jats:italic> are becoming increasingly common in coastal wetlands in the Gulf of Mexico (USA). As mangroves displace salt marsh vegetation, there may be consequences for associated wetland fauna. In a series of field studies, we compared prey refuge values between marsh and mangrove vegetation for a vertically migrating gastropod, the marsh periwinkle <jats:italic>Littoraria irrorata</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>Littoraria</jats:italic> were tethered to marsh grasses (<jats:italic>Spartina alterniflora</jats:italic>) or the aerial roots (pneumatophores) of <jats:italic>Avicennia</jats:italic> in arrays that fully crossed vegetation type (<jats:italic>Spartina</jats:italic> vs. <jats:italic>Avicennia</jats:italic>), tether height (base vs. canopy), and wetland location (edge vs. interior marsh platform). After 1 d, acute predation rates were twice as high on <jats:italic>Littoraria</jats:italic> tethered to the base of <jats:italic>Spartina</jats:italic> stems than on those tethered to pneumatophores, suggesting that mangroves provided superior refuge from benthic predators like blue crabs. In the canopy, <jats:italic>Spartina</jats:italic> reduced acute predation rates by 75%, indicating that marsh grasses may provide superior refuge from aerial predators (possibly wetland birds). After 7 d, the effect of vegetation type diminished, but <jats:italic>Littoraria</jats:italic> mortality was 2 times higher on the benthos than in the canopy. Links between vegetation type and predation intensity on this important basal consumer may have broader consequences for trophic dynamics in coastal wetlands that are experiencing mangrove encroachment.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Power suppliers in a dynamic power market can achieve full benefit by introducing a bidding strategy mechanism. In the power sector, renewable resources have significant gradual usage and their effect on the production of detailed bidding approaches is becoming further complicated in the industry. Due to the irregular nature of these renewable resources and because they are subject to several fluctuations, there is an inherent issue with generating electricity. Taking these considerations into account, attempts have been made to create a model of bidding strategy to optimize the benefit of the electricity producers using the oppositional gravitational search algorithm. The Weibull and Beta distribution functions are utilized to describe the stochastic characteristics of the wind-speed profile and solar-irradiation, respectively. For the IEEE-30 and IEEE-57 frameworks, the suggested method is being checked and explained. In comparison to other optimization approaches, the results of this approach were taken into account, and it was discovered that it outperformed other techniques in addressing bid difficulties. In addition, it is worth noting that the impact of renewable energy on the bidding strategy lowered market clearing and thermal power generating costs, and encouraged renewable influenced producers to put forward the excess electricity into the real-time market.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>An 11-level switched-capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI) with 2.5 times boosting feature is presented in this paper. It can produce an 11-level output voltage waveform by utilizing 14 switches, 3 capacitors, 2 diodes, and 1 DC source. Only nine driver circuits are needed as the topology has three pairs of complementary switches and two bidirectional switches. It has inherent capacitor self-balancing property as the capacitors are connected across the DC voltage source during several states within a fundamental cycle to charge the capacitors to the input voltage. A detailed comparison shows the effectiveness of the proposed topology in terms of the number of switches, number of capacitors, number of sources, total standing voltage (TSV), efficiency, and boosting ability with the state-of-art recently proposed circuits. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed SCMLI is validated experimentally utilizing the nearest level control (NLC), a fundamental frequency-based switching technique.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>A new triple voltage boosting switched-capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI) is presented in this paper. It can produce 13-level output voltage waveform by utilizing 12 switches, three diodes, three capacitors, and one DC source. The capacitor voltages are self-balanced as all the three capacitors present in the circuit are connected across the DC source to charge it to the desired voltage level for several instants in one fundamental cycle. A detailed comparative analysis is carried to show the advantages of the proposed topology in terms of the number of switches, number of capacitors, number of sources, total standing voltage (TSV), and boosting of the converter with the recently published 13-level topologies. The nearest level control (NLC)-based algorithm is used for generating switching signals for the IGBTs present in the circuit. The TSV of the proposed converter is 22. Experimental results are obtained for different loading conditions by using a laboratory hardware prototype to validate the simulation results. The efficiency of the proposed inverter is 97.2% for a 200 watt load.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Automated deep-sea container terminals are the main hubs to move millions of containers in today's global supply chains. Terminal operators often decouple the landside and waterside operations by stacking containers in stacks perpendicular to the quay. Traditionally, a single automated stacking cranes (ASC) is deployed at each stack to handle containers. A recent trend is to use new configurations with more than one crane to improve efficiency. A variety of new configurations have been implemented, such as twin, double, and triple ASCs. In this paper, the authors explore and review the mixed integer programming models that have been developed for the stacking operations of these new configurations. They further discuss how these models can be extended to contemplate diverse operational constraints including precedence constraints, interference constraints, and other objective functions.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>An innovative union of fuzzy controller and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller under the environment of fractional order (FO) calculus is described in the present study for an isolated hybrid power system (IHPS) in the context of load frequency control. The proposed controller is designated as FO-fuzzy PID (FO-F-PID) controller. The undertaken model of IHPS presented here involves different independent power-producing units, a wind energy-based generator, a diesel engine-based generator and a device for energy storage (such as a superconducting magnetic energy storage system). The selection of the system and controller gains was achieved through a unique quasi-oppositional harmony search (QOHS) algorithm. The QOHS algorithm is based on the basic harmony search (HS) algorithm, in which the combined concept of quasi-opposition initialization and HS algorithm fastens the profile of convergence for the algorithm. The competency and potency of the intended FO-F-PID controller were verified by comparing its performance with three different controllers (integer-order (IO)-fuzzy-PID (IO-F-PID) controller, FO-PID and IO-PID controller) in terms of deviation in frequency and power under distinct perturbations in load demand conditions. The obtained simulation results validate the cutting-edge functioning of the projected FO-F-PID controller over the IO-F-PID, FO-PID and IO-PID controllers under non-linear and linear functioning conditions. In addition, the intended FO-F-PID controller, considered a hybrid model, proved to be more robust against the mismatches in loading and the non-linearity in the form of rate constraint under the deviation in frequency and power front.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Predators affect prey through mortality, and prey respond by employing antipredatory strategies. Although leatherback sea turtles <jats:italic>Dermochelys coriacea</jats:italic> are the largest sea turtle, they are susceptible to shark predation. Females lay multiple clutches of eggs separated by a ~10 d internesting interval at sea, during which they move many kilometers away from the nesting beach. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that this wide-ranging behavior was associated with predator avoidance. To accomplish this goal, we used animal-borne video and data recorders along with satellite telemetry to monitor diving behavior and track the at-sea movements of females during the internesting intervals on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. After they departed the nesting beach, females immediately swam a mean maximum distance of 101 km from St. Croix. The mean transit distance during 10.19 d at sea was 466 km. We recorded 102 periods during which females inverted and rotated vigorously for an average of 2.7 min at or near the surface. Because females nesting on St. Croix commonly exhibit scars and fresh wounds, many of which result from shark encounters, this behavior likely represents a defensive response to predator attack. The frequency of defensive behaviors that occurred &lt;6 km from the nesting beach (4.6 d<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) was 3.3-fold greater than when they were &gt;6 km from shore (1.4 d<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>). By moving offshore, females reduced the possibility of predator encounters by 53%.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>The objective of the present paper is to study the optimum installation of Non-dispatchable Distributed Generations (NDG) in the distribution network of given sizes under the given scheme. The uncertainty of various random (uncertain) parameters like load, wind and solar operated DG besides uncertainty of fuel prices has been investigated by the three-point estimate method (3-PEM) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) based methods. Nearly twenty percent of the total number of buses are selected as candidate buses for NDG placement on the basis of system voltage profile to limit the search space. Weibull probability density function (PDF) is considered to address uncertain characteristics of solar radiation and wind speed under different scenarios. Load uncertainty is described by Standard Normal Distribution Function (SNDF). To investigate the solution of optimal probabilistic load flow (OPLF) three-point PEM-based technique was applied. For optimization, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and GA-PSO hybrid-based Artificial Intelligent (AI) based optimization techniques are employed to achieve the optimum value of the multi-objectives function. The proposed multi-objective function comprises loss and different costs. The proposed methods have been applied to IEEE 33- bus radial distribution network. Simulation results obtained by these techniques are compared based on loss minimization capability, enhancement of system bus voltage profile and reduction of cost and fitness functions. The major findings of the present study are the PEM-based method which provides almost similar results as MCS based method with less computation time and as far as loss minimization capacity, voltage profile improvement etc. is concerned, the hybrid-based optimization methods are compared with GA and PSO based optimization techniques.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Dissolution of carbonate platforms, like The Bahamas, throughout Quaternary sea-level oscillations have created mature karst landscapes that can include sinkholes and off-shore blue holes. These karst features are flooded by saline oceanic waters and meteoric-influenced groundwaters, which creates unique groundwater environments and ecosystems. Little is known about the modern benthic meiofauna, like foraminifera, in these environments or how internal hydrographic characteristics of salinity, dissolved oxygen, or pH may influence benthic habitat viability. Here we compare the total benthic foraminiferal distributions in sediment-water interface samples collected from &amp;lt;2 m water depth on the carbonate tidal flats, and the two subtidal blue holes Freshwater River Blue Hole and Meredith’s Blue Hole, on the leeward margin of Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas. All samples are dominated by miliolid foraminifera (i.e., <jats:italic>Quinqueloculina</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Triloculina</jats:italic>), yet notable differences emerge in the secondary taxa between these two environments that allows identification of two assemblages: a Carbonate Tidal Flats Assemblage (CTFA) vs. a Blue Hole Assemblage (BHA). The CTFA includes abundant common shallow-water lagoon foraminifera (e.g., <jats:italic>Peneroplis</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Rosalina</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Rotorbis</jats:italic>), while the BHA has higher proportions of foraminifera that are known to tolerate stressful environmental conditions of brackish and dysoxic waters elsewhere (e.g., <jats:italic>Pseudoeponides</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cribroelphidium</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Ammonia</jats:italic>). We also observe how the hydrographic differences between subtidal blue holes can promote different benthic habitats for foraminifera, and this is observed through differences in both agglutinated and hyaline fauna. The unique hydrographic conditions in subtidal blue holes make them great laboratories for assessing the response of benthic foraminiferal communities to extreme environmental conditions (e.g., low pH, dysoxia).</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>The world today is plagued with problems of increased transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses leading to poor reliability due to power outages and an increase in the expenditure on electrical infrastructure. To address these concerns, technology has evolved to enable the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) like solar, wind, diesel and biomass energy into small scale self-governing power system zones which are known as micro-grids (MGs). A de-centralised approach for modern power grid systems has led to an increased focus on distributed energy resources and demand response. MGs act as complete power system units albeit on a small scale. However, this does not prevent them from large operational sophistication allowing their independent functioning in both grid-connected and stand-alone modes. MGs provide greater reliability as compared to the entire system owing to the large amount of information secured from the bulk system. They comprise numerous sources like solar, wind, diesel along with storage devices and converters. Several modeling schemes have been devised to reduce the handling burden of large scale systems. This paper gives a detailed review of MGs and their architecture, state space representation of wind energy conversion systems &amp; solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, operating modes and power management in a MG and its impact on a distribution network.</jats:p>

N2  - The transformation of conventional power networks into smart grids with the
heavy penetration level of renewable energy resources, particularly
grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) systems, has increased the need for efficient
fault identification systems. Malfunctioning any single component in
grid-connected PV systems may lead to grid instability and other serious
consequences, showing that a reliable fault identification system is the utmost
requirement for ensuring operational integrity. Therefore, this paper presents
a novel fault identification approach based on statistical signatures of PV
operational states. These signatures are unique because each fault has a
different nature and distinctive impact on the electrical system. Thus, the
Random Forest Classifier trained on these extracted signatures showed 100%
accuracy in identifying all types of faults. Furthermore, the performance
comparison of the proposed framework with other Machine Learning classifiers
depicts its credibility. Moreover, to elevate user trust in the predicted
outcomes, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) was utilized during the training
phase to extract a complete model response (global explanation). This extracted
global explanation can help in the assessment of predicted outcomes credibility
by decoding each prediction in terms of features contribution. Hence, the
proposed explainable signature-based fault identification technique is highly

N2  - <jats:p>The extensive employment of power semiconductor devices in multilevel inverters (MLIs) has the consequence of increased failure probabilities. With numerous applications demanding highly reliable inverters, several fault-tolerant schemes have been devised to address switch open-circuit faults. This paper analyzes a multilevel inverter topology for IGBT modules undergoing open-circuit faults, a major impediment to reliable operation within a power converter. Reconfiguration of modulation is performed post-fault. A modulation scheme is implemented across failure modes as a hybrid of nearest level control and selective harmonic elimination. Reliability assessment of the topology is performed, including a comparison with previous literature in terms of component requirements and reliability. Simulation results validate the proposed solutions.</jats:p>

N2  - <jats:p>Multilevel inverters (MLIs) are capable of producing high-quality output voltage and handling large amounts of power. This reduces the size of the filter while also simplifying the circuitry. As a result, they have a wide range of applications in industries, particularly in smart grids. The input voltage boosting feature is required to use the MLI with renewable energy. Moreover, many components are required to get higher output voltage levels that add weight and cost to the circuit. Numerous MLI topologies have been identified to minimize the losses, device count, and device ratings. A seven-level modified H-bridge inverter with a reduced component count, and reduced THD is presented in this paper. Two DC sources with six IGBTs have been used to generate a seven-level output voltage, and the Aquila Optimizer (AO) has been implemented to get the regulated output. MATLAB/Simulink environment has been used for designing the simulation model. Furthermore, the simulation result has been validated in the laboratory on a hardware setup using the DSP-TMS320F28335 Launchpad. With the reduced number of switching devices as well as the dc supply, the size of the inverter is compacted and becomes more economical.</jats:p>
