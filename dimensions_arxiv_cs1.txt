Several previous\ncandidates for one-way group actions no longer stand, due to progress both on\nclassical algorithms (e.g., graph isomorphism) and quantum algorithms (e.g.,\ndiscrete logarithm).\n  We propose the general linear group action on tensors as a new candidate to\nbuild cryptography based on group actions. Recent works\n(Futorny--Grochow--Sergeichuk, Lin. Alg. Appl., 2019) suggest that the\nunderlying algorithmic problem, the tensor isomorphism problem, is the hardest\none among several isomorphism testing problems arising from areas including\ncoding theory, computational group theory, and multivariate cryptography. We\npresent evidence to justify the viability of this proposal from comprehensive\nstudy of the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, theoretical algorithms, and\nhardness results, as well as quantum algorithms.\n  We then introduce a new notion called pseudorandom group actions to further\ndevelop group-action based cryptography. Briefly speaking, given a group $G$\nacting on a set $S$, we assume that it is hard to distinguish two distributions\nof $(s, t)$ either uniformly chosen from $S\\times S$, or where $s$ is randomly\nchosen from $S$ and $t$ is the result of applying a random group action of\n$g\\in G$ on $s$. This subsumes the classical decisional Diffie-Hellman\nassumption when specialized to a particular group action.

In this paper,\nwe propose a channel quality indicator (CQI) prediction method in a deep\nlearning approach in that a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. An online\ntraining module is introduced for the downlink scheduling in the 5G New Radio\n(NR) system, to reduce the negative impact of outdated CQI for communication\ndegradation, especially in high-speed mobility scenarios. First, we analyze the\nimpact of outdated CQI in the downlink scheduling of the 5G NR system. Then, we\ndesign a data generation and online training module to evaluate our prediction\nmethod in ns-3. The simulation results show that the proposed LSTM method\noutperforms the Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) method on improving the\nsystem performance of the downlink transmission. Our study may provide insights\ninto designing new deep learning algorithms to enhance the network performance\nof the 5G NR system."}, "authors": [{"name": "Hao Yin"}, {"name": "Xiaojun Guo"}, {"name": "Pengyu Liu"}, {"name": "Xiaojun Hei"}, {"name": "Yayu Gao"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Yayu Gao"}, "author": "Yayu Gao", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01000v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01000v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.NI", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.NI", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09259v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09259v1", "updated": "2019-06-21T17:57:54Z", "updated_parsed": [2019, 6, 21, 17, 57, 54, 4, 172, 0], "published": "2019-06-21T17:57:54Z", "published_parsed": [2019, 6, 21, 17, 57, 54, 4, 172, 0], "title": "Multi-Server Private Information Retrieval with Coded Side Information", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Multi-Server Private Information Retrieval with Coded Side Information"}, "summary": "In this paper, we study the multi-server setting of the \\emph{Private\nInformation Retrieval with Coded Side Information (PIR-CSI)} problem.

IoT devices in smart homes and\ncities and connected building infrastructure present a compelling use case for\nnovelty detection with OCSVM due to the variety of devices, traffic patterns,\nand types of anomalies that can manifest in such environments. Much previous\nresearch has thus applied OCSVM to novelty detection for IoT. Unfortunately,\nconventional OCSVMs introduce significant memory requirements and are\ncomputationally expensive at prediction time as the size of the train set\ngrows, requiring space and time that scales with the number of training points.\nThese memory and computational constraints can be prohibitive in practical,\nreal-world deployments, where large training sets are typically needed to\ndevelop accurate models when fitting complex decision boundaries. In this work,\nwe extend so-called Nystr\\\"om and (Gaussian) Sketching approaches to OCSVM, by\ncombining these methods with clustering and Gaussian mixture models to achieve\nsignificant speedups in prediction time and space in various IoT settings,\nwithout sacrificing detection accuracy."}, "authors": [{"name": "Kun Yang"}, {"name": "Samory Kpotufe"}, {"name": "Nick Feamster"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Nick Feamster"}, "author": "Nick Feamster", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11146v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11146v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.NI", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.NI", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}]}, {"id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12245v1", "guidislink": true, "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12245v1", "updated": "2018-10-29T16:45:39Z", "updated_parsed": [2018, 10, 29, 16, 45, 39, 0, 302, 0], "published": "2018-10-29T16:45:39Z", "published_parsed": [2018, 10, 29, 16, 45, 39, 0, 302, 0], "title": "Prediction of Discretization of GMsFEM using Deep Learning", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "Prediction of Discretization of GMsFEM using Deep Learning"}, "summary": "In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based approach to a class of\nmultiscale problems.

We assume that the\nobservation at each node randomly falls into one of two modes: a valid or an\ninvalid observation mode. Specifically, mode one corresponds to the desired\nsignal plus noise observation mode (\\emph{valid}), and mode two corresponds to\nthe pure noise mode (\\emph{invalid}) due to node defect or damage. With no\nprior information on such local sensing modes, we introduce a learning-based\ndistributed procedure, called the mixed detection-estimation (MDE) algorithm,\nbased on iterative closed-loop interactions between mode learning (detection)\nand target estimation. The online learning step re-assesses the validity of the\nlocal observations at each iteration, thus refining the ongoing estimation\nupdate process. The convergence of the MDE algorithm is established\nanalytically. Asymptotic analysis shows that, in the high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) regime, the MDE estimation error converges to that of an ideal\n(centralized) estimator with perfect information about the node sensing modes.\nThis is in contrast to the estimation performance of a naive average consensus\nbased distributed estimator (without mode learning), whose estimation error\nblows up with an increasing SNR."}, "authors": [{"name": "Qing Zhou"}, {"name": "Di Li"}, {"name": "Soummya Kar"}, {"name": "Lauren Huie"}, {"name": "H.

In the\nspirit of the compute and forward paradigm, we present a multilevel coding\nscheme that permits computation (or, decoding) of a class of functions at the\nrelay. The function to be computed (or, decoded) is then chosen depending on\nthe channel realization. We define such a class of functions which can be\ndecoded at the relay using the proposed coding scheme and derive rates that are\nuniversally achievable over a set of channel gains when this class of functions\nis used at the relay. We develop our framework with general modulation formats\nin mind, but numerical results are presented for the case where each node\ntransmits using the QPSK constellation. Numerical results with QPSK show that\nthe flexibility afforded by our proposed scheme results in substantially higher\nrates than those achievable by always using a fixed function or by adapting the\nfunction at the relay but coding over GF(4)."}, "authors": [{"name": "Brett Hern"}, {"name": "Krishna Narayanan"}], "author_detail": {"name": "Krishna Narayanan"}, "author": "Krishna Narayanan", "arxiv_doi": "10.1109/TIT.2013.2271771", "links": [{"title": "doi", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2271771", "rel": "related", "type": "text/html"}, {"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2690v2", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.2690v2", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_comment": "This paper was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory\n  in July 2011.
